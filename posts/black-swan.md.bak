I've been listening to the book little by little.
And I there are some interesting ideas in the book.
One idea as I recall it is that if a war goes for one year,
assume it will go for another year;
if it goes for two years then assume additional two.

So first I got to think about unpredictability of finishing wars.
Then the next day some reality-show coup grabbed everybody's attention.
Yet at the evening of the same day things "normalized" as if nothing happened.
So as an illustration to the book I got to experience some mutant two-headed black-swan.

Also there is some odd entertainment value in knowing that the author has
irrational issue with normal distribution
so he injects complaining remarks about it all over the place.
But overall this type of entertainment is not what I'm used to.

And along with the blind-spot author has he loaded the book with different shiny things.
For example the author surely tied to spice the book with french words all over,
but it did not add style.

Also I was listening at 1.5x speed and that only escalated perceived non-seriousness.

On one hand it is not perfect to not finish books.
On the other hand one should trust own judgement.
So I cut it short.
