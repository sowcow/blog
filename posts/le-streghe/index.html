Red color is favored there.
Some shots are very likeable." />

  <section><p><strong>Spoilers Land</strong></p>
<p>The movie has multiple parts.
I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in.
And then to write more gave another look.
And then I could not resisit another look&hellip;</p>
<p>The setting is in the Alps.
Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls.
Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points&hellip;
Red color is favored there.
Some shots are very likeable.</p>
<p>After the first watch you are left with the dark feeling of that hard trade.
Life-continuaiton versus this brilliant illusion and play.</p>
<p>On the second watch I got questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>when she ordered gin there was emphasis - did she knew already at that point?</li>
<li>when looking around and not finding - I&rsquo;m not sure what was not found (she as everybody found the ring - there is something else)&hellip;</li>
<li>anyway, surrounding - I felt like surrounding is so messed-up that if changing of direction was planned - the surrounding must had been changed first</li>
<li>lower class of birth - that may be keeping her career choice - because how otherwise would she keep the level relative to more connected competitors? (represented by the odd jealous people in green and pink in the picture)</li>
</ul>
<p>One fun aspect of the movie is her friend and her relatinship with own husband.
She messes with him so badly.
The protagonist messes with males for fun too but her way is exusable while her friends way is extremely comical.
Always not alone - distractions are plenty, and being witful the protagonist does what she does best - plays.</p>
<p>Maybe this signifies some genre change in the industry.
She and her friend play different genres.</p>
<p>One idea is that her magical attractiveness is because of that fire that actually can burn her.
So the name of the part is: Witch Burned Alive.</p>
<p>Also this more competitive aspect of the tradeoff restores the control of the protagonist so it is not some dark fall when something is lost as it may feel by the viewer.
But more like the dark journey and further rise for the &ldquo;Witch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This short-picture by Visconti ended up being a journey too.</p>
<p>Anyway I got dragged-in into it.
Normally I watch something different in the new year but now that place was empty and this picture just took that place and established itself.</p>
<p><strong>UPD:</strong></p>
<p>Of course it is so obvious what she was looking and wasn&rsquo;t able to find is to have what the hostess has.
That ring with brilliants means both that level of status and children.
I have not expected such a nice puzzle and a beautiful one too.
I bet there are gems to find in other Visconti movies that I watched only once.</p>
