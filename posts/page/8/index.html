    <h2>Contextless</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is an interesting for me kind of posts where I explore near some more practical idea and that idea by itself may be only lightly implied or touched. Or I go on some random tangent and the case that got me writing is completely ignored.
In this one the tangent is that contextless things imply reactive behavior.
So I think that goal of advertisments for exapmle is to distract a person into situation for which the subject does not have the context ready....</p>

    <h2>Continuity of Space</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.
Abstract:
 time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can’t put your attention on it the space around us is what is actually persistent and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it active attention is what I mean in the post....</p>

    <h2>Viridiana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow but it always finds a way to astonish you.
I don’t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective. I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I’m so used to like. But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation. It is just that odd and in a way immutable. This way of looking at it seems new to me....</p>

    <h2>La Charme Discret De La Bourgeoisie</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.
Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.
I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.
Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
 NOTE: some spoilers ahead
 The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is....</p>

    <h2>Callas Forever</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.
The beginning predictably left me not excited. The movie provides some words to describe it: “too modern”. And the word “flat” came to my mind too. No idea why. I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.
At the end of the first third you get to see some development and get intrigued by it....</p>

    <h2>Blender</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Threre is this blender-question related to apple hiring.
Initially I thought: “what a stupid question”:
 amygdala stuff at the core incomplete and nonsensical context  So in abstract this question primes for stupidity. Although in the context of hiring interview I assume that primes for some creativity.
I have no idea if it is useful in the hiring context. But in abstract it is like an ugly but educational toy....</p>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days. It can be summarized this way: I didn’t beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter. And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that. But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.
Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view....</p>

    <h2>Half Watch</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).
It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.
Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.
I think that it works this way:...</p>

    <h2>Sparrow</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well. Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing. And that I’m not the right audience for the theme overall. And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.
During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work. At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet....</p>

    <h2>La Notte</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say… I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas…
I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.
Pros:
 Some nice shots are present Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there  Cons:
 pace is not for me messy so called “psychological” stuff about characters being unhappy and all that does not attract me ugly sounds play from time to time  Notables:...</p>
