    <h2>Collective Lies</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it. The stuff even felt attractive in theory.
So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.
What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points. It didn’t look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan....</p>

    <h2>D and D</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have a couple of things that I noticed while reading “Discrimination and Disparities” by T. Sowell.
Obviously the authour is a very logical and factual no BS guy.
The book is full of tricks politicans use and facts they tend to hide.
I noticed this disambiguation of the term “discrimination” by the author:
 evidence based discrimination (1A): based on knowledge of traits and behavior of a given individual evidence based discrimination (1B): based on statistics on group behavior, traits arbitrary discrimination (2): arbitrary/irrational  This is how I understood this....</p>

    <h2>Tar Pit</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I decided to write short summary and some ideas after reading “Out of the Tar Pit”.
Summary It looks like a theoretical high level paper about comlexity in large codebases.
The main point can be statend in the form: eliminate stuff/separate certain parts of the system to reduce power/ability to introduce accedintal complexity.
What is being separated: essential state, essential logic, control.
Also proposed ways to implement these parts:
 state - relaitons logic - pure functions  My Thoughts I am pretty convinced that relations are the way to go for the essential state....</p>

    <h2>Das Right</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The word “rights” is the most prominent example of language abuse for politics sake.
 It is short and not some yet another pseudo scientific “-ism”, “-fobia”. So it looks more natural on the outset; It has “right” in it :) You can create new “rights” every day by adding different perfixes; You can use it to extract something from somebody; Since it is vague term it can have broad uses especially when it comes to general public; It also informs users on how to act/behave when demanding something from others: righteously;  ...</p>

    <h2>Random Code Thoughts</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So I decided to put some thoughts about my coding here. There are three of them.
Copy-pasting This is one of my time wasters. I have this expectation that copy-pasted block should just work. But then there are little details that I miss that require a debugging session later.
Copy pasting by itself is not that evil. It can be avoided by additional abstractions. But you don’t want to commit to any random abstraction either....</p>

    <h2>Till You Make It</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself. I thought that there has to be a reason for that. And indeed I found couple of them.
Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it’s source.
And then I thought about artificial sources.
Given say body positivity. When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves. This is ambiguous....</p>

    <h2>Random Dentist Experience</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this “session”. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time....</p>

    <h2>Caesar</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I really like reading History of Gallic Wars by Caesar.
There are interesting small details everywhere: details about politics, contracts, warfare, decision making.
The narrative itself is also quite fascinating to me.
Also national differences that are depicted in the book are quite entertaining....</p>

    <h2>Excitement</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Another interesting insight from reading GTD is that there is a level of positive feelings you get from envisioning future results of your projects.
The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process. So the need to have “artificial sweeteners” goes down.
I think that excitement is the only reasonable expectation from your projects with this system....</p>

    <h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.
 The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.  So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons. And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.
BTW I use org-mode to implement it. I am happy with the proccess....</p>
