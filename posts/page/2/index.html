    <h2>Der Himmel über Berlin</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there. After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.
On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights. And this sets the standard and expectation. So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used. But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact....</p>

    <h2>Langscape</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Langscape I didn’t read much so my verbal faculty is likely more affected by programming than by stories. More affected by reflection than by communication.
The way I use language in these posts is in a way minimalistic and analytical. I assume the text file supports the brain working memory. That maybe frees some pattern recognition resources. And recognizing patterns should build the ability to recognize them in general.
So my verbal space is always incomplete at least culturally....</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Clouds</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).
There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not. It is very satisfying to see the director’s play and then he confirms it too.
That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested. It is a funny scene on the first look.
Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes....</p>

    <h2>Three Names</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time. Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website. The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.
one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that next is the English version of the name; but I’m not from England or the US Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion....</p>

    <h2>Black Swan</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve been listening to the book little by little. And I there are some interesting ideas in the book. One idea as I recall it is that if a war goes for one year, assume it will go for another year; if it goes for two years then assume additional two.
So first I got to think about unpredictability of finishing wars. Then the next day some reality-show coup grabbed everybody’s attention....</p>

    <h2>Et in Arcadia ego</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I’ve got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately. Then I’ve read some Gombrich and there he features the painting. The painting straightened me up a bit.
Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself. This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.
Picture I enjoyed the piece for sure. If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findings then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well....</p>

    <h2>Three Holes</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I didn’t plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially. But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day. In fact I’ll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.
So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to....</p>

   <p>Rich movie, unforgettable images Lots of echoes inside Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time. Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.
Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie....</p>
