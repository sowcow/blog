  <section><p>Beautiful aesthetics.
Not to say about views of Venice and Italy.
Both strong feelings and something different also.</p>
<p>My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :).
The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different.
So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!</p>
<p>There is a class difference that I see in different movies.
Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.</p>
<p>Then first Franz acheives certain success that never was his.
Starts being &ldquo;just himself&rdquo; and gets ruined by lack of his illusion that he saw in mirrors.</p>
<p>Then he breaks Livia&rsquo;s illusion about that relationship.</p>
<p>At the culmination Livia is:</p>
<ul>
<li>put down as a female</li>
<li>shown to be a traitor of closest people</li>
<li>shown to be like him? (non-aristocratic, shallow person) while spending all aristocratic capital (that was never her?)</li>
</ul>
<p>So she becomes indirectly a murderer also.</p>
<p>Big cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lofty illusions that mismatch the reality</li>
<li>blindness to others and own nature (shallow/deep and male/female brains and confusing successfull crooks for nobility)</li>
<li>(age and) class mismatch in relationships</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Of course the husband being a complete fool also contributed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also age difference.</li>
<li>Not paying attention and not being able to control the wife.</li>
<li>Not recognizing a &ldquo;threat&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the husband and very cooperative handmaid are comedic players there.</p>
<p>Human passions are compared to warfare it seems.
Interestingly that Livia enters the war scene to help Roberto.
But she gets conquered herself.
In this war some people died on a hill.
Some got ruined in passions and broken illusions.</p>
<p>Broken mirror I think summarizes events in the movie.</p>
