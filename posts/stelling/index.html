First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.
Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.
Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :)." />

  <section><h2 id="non-stelling">Non-Stelling</h2>
<p>First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.</p>
<p>Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.</p>
<p>Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :).</p>
<p>Concerning Coffee and Cigarettes.
The movie getting to be my tradition to watch every year or so.</p>
<h2 id="stelling">Stelling</h2>
<p>I watched most of Stelling recently.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:
I&rsquo;m not a movie enthusiast normally.
I cannot evaluate director&rsquo;s skill and tools they use although I can notice them from time to time.</p>
<p>But I like movies with rewatch value for sure and that implies they have hidden sides
that you don&rsquo;t recognize at first although you may have clues into them hanging around.</p>
<p>For example the most conspicuous mess of movies can be anything of Lynch.
It is intentionally and obviously &ldquo;a salad&rdquo; with very different foods rubbing each other
and the user should make sense from that their own way.</p>
<p>Back to the Stelling.</p>
<p>The Hollander is definetly a movie that takes it&rsquo;s unique place in your memory.
But for me the second watch (after a day or so after the first one) have provided that experience.</p>
<p>The first watch was not enough to put it near Lynch (by that score of being a rich food for interpretation).
Clues were there but not enough to be enchanted by them.</p>
<p>My memory does not hold plot stuff normally but more like unique visuals or some interactions.
There is a memorable &ldquo;scene&rdquo; or as I would like to say &ldquo;a phrase&rdquo; (Is it reading Brodsky has effects on me?).
There are sounds and non-related to the plot normally visuals that I remember.</p>
<p>I think that a good movie has a rewatch value soon while the memory is fresh.</p>
