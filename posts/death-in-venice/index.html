Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.
Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.
I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies
and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.
I haven&rsquo;t read the book.
I have checked some comments on the internet.
And I assume the movie is better than the book given how Visconti uses his visual space." />

  <section><h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>
<p>Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.</p>
<p>Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.</p>
<p>I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies
and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book.
I have checked some comments on the internet.
And I assume the movie is better than the book given how Visconti uses his visual space.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-is-not">What it is not</h2>
<p>So there is a dull interpretation that a movie is about some odd perverted but distant relation.</p>
<p>Although it is totally understandable that people can get too distracted and mislead by that stuff.</p>
<p>Even though the movie is ambiguous by intent.
One should be a fool to think that the movie is about that given how strong Visconti uses his tools to deliver another story.</p>
<p>Not idea what is the case in the book. But Visconti modified and added to the story in a strong way.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-have-been-able-to-see">What I have been able to see</h2>
<p>Visconti changed a writer to a musician.
Added great dialogs with a friend about music.
And there are other things that if you have seen them then you can&rsquo;t unsee them through the movie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go into details but Visconti leaves very obvious clues.</p>
<p>The movie is rich in a sense that there are contrasts everywhere.
And there is likely to be some point behind each of them.</p>
<h2 id="what-experience-i-lack-for-the-movie">What experience I lack for the movie</h2>
<p>That reflection of Esmeralda in the mirror. It has to be related to a real painting or else there is something the director says.
Watching the The Flying Dutchman and now this movie pushes me a bit to to get my knowledge of the history visual arts to some level.</p>
<p>Music. I got a midi keyboard lately and was trying it as an entertainment.
Actually even a couple years before I tried another instrument but it didn&rsquo;t fit me.
Anyway in the movie I have found that I just ignore music or just experience it as a background
except for scenes where Visconti is very explicit about it.
I bet Visconti synthesised music and a picture in a way that is worth looknig into.
But bigger understanding of music at least may be needed here.</p>
<h1 id="spoilers-though">Spoilers though!</h1>
<h2 id="favourite-scene">Favourite scene</h2>
<p>My favorite scene is the scene of fiasco and how a friend musician Albert acts there.
I&rsquo;m being cold and stingy in words here but the scene should say for itself.</p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of interesting scenes.</p>
<h2 id="small-observations-and-clues">Small observations and clues</h2>
<p>These are not big ones but I couldn&rsquo;t resist to mention them.</p>
<p>One interesting interpretation is that Tadzio is an angel of death.
Which is cool.</p>
<p>The idea of duality is represented alot there I have a couple of ideas about that but I&rsquo;ll let it open.</p>
<h2 id="my-interpretation">My interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the biggest of spoilers I guess but not the biggest key that opens a road to this interpretation.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read much on the internet about the movie so I can&rsquo;t say if I&rsquo;m writing anything new here.</p>
<p>One thing I have read is that Tadzio represents non-romantic beauty.</p>
<p>I can go more specifically and say that he represents a beautiful melody or sound that an artist seeks.
There are big clues supporting that.</p>
<p>When a human tries to be source of art he gets crushed by a fiasco.</p>
<p>When the composer actually finds that beautiful sound it goes far and wide from the artist
leaving him behind crushed.</p>
<h1 id="the-mother-of-all-spoilers">The Mother Of All Spoilers</h1>
<p>While writing this post I came to understand the last scene so I will write that here too and with some support info.</p>
<p>I feel like finding this stuff is very gratifying. Maybe reading it can also be but why would I read other&rsquo;s reviews when I can watch the movie by myself?</p>
<p>If one wants to find such stuff on thir own they should practice paying attention and looking for interpretations.
Or watching multiple times can be used if the movie is of a such quality to provide more with the next session.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-cant-unsee">What you can&rsquo;t unsee</h2>
<p>Piano.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-scene">The last scene</h2>
<p>It can be interestingly interpreted as the angel of death charging an arrow.
There is probabably a truth to it.</p>
<p>The gesture is likely to have own meaning (some painting or the Sun).</p>
<p>But most importantly.</p>
<p>Tadzio puts a note to the notes staff created by the sea line.
I bet the note plays at the culmination.</p>
<h2 id="very-cool">Very cool</h2>
<p>Very cool that I have no training with music and I got my first midi keyboard just two months ago and was playing around.
Without that it would not be possible for me to solve the gesture.</p>
<p>And there are still plenty of signs or whole explicit aspects of that are left for interpretation. As it says in the movie: The art is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Visconti masterfully shapes the canvas to reveal ideas.
The movie actually revived my interest in music and visual arts.</p>
