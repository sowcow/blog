  <section><p>I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all.
But this time I decided to look into his content.</p>
<p>First I got into some debate youtube videos of him.
And it was ok.</p>
<p>So I decided to look into his audiobook.</p>
<p>I found the first part quite informative for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really like biological facts about how things work</li>
<li>Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me</li>
<li>I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others)</li>
</ul>
<p>But then after 50% the real fun starts.</p>
<p>The guy starts preaching like an exhalted priest before a crowd of astonished peasants.</p>
<p>He preaches stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;you have sinned&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;become aware of your covardness, haterd&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;consider the murderousness of your own spirit&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;pledge to alleviate all unnecessary pain and suffering&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;because the only alternative is hell/nazi camps&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>And the author uses german words and interjects holocaust stories here and there.
And forces readers to beleive that the meaning of life for them is to be some vegan-antifa-bodhisattva or so.</p>
<p>If you think this can&rsquo;t get more deranged than that.
Then you ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet.</p>
<p>The author starts reading (audio book) like he is crying until the end of the chapter.
I thought pure guy was forced to read that way.</p>
<p>And then to finally and irrevocably humiliate himself and intellect of anybody listening to this stuff the author proceeds with verbal images describing how good his idea of meaning is.</p>
<p>Literally stuff like: buddha sitting on a rose, etc&hellip;
(I am not listening to this stuff again to get exact quotes)</p>
<p>And I beleive that the key phrase in his crying part was: &ldquo;when all evil of the past is justified&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="omg">Omg</h2>
<p>So I had to google this guy.
I found that he has some fanatical followers.</p>
<p>Obviously you can&rsquo;t attract smart people with stuff like that.</p>
<p>Anyway this was a good point to quit the book for me.
Because I have no idea what to expect from the guy.</p>
<p>As a psychologist so ho knows if he has some tricks up his sleeve.</p>
<p>And his content is not worth it for me to pay additional attention and to double check his stuff just in case he tries to deceive me somehow.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>He first convinces audience that they are innately evil.</li>
<li>Then he provides them with meaning of life as
actively not being as evil/bad as he convinced them they should
image themselves</li>
<li>He literally says that if you disagree with him
then you should be scared</li>
<li>He covers this stuff with crying (in audio version) and
with a pile of irrelevant images</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway he is using manipulation.
There is no argument to refute.</p>
<p>When I see manipulation/dishonesty I assume bad will.</p>
<h2 id="manipulation">Manipulation</h2>
<p>He uses images alot.</p>
<p>At one point he writes how he saves his daughter from another misbehaving child.
At another point he writes how he forces a child to sleep.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if stories like that can be used as part of manipulation over some audiences.</p>
<p>There are blog posts that analyze fallacies he often to uses.</p>
<p>Anyway it is not what I am into at this point.</p>
<p>So I am finished with the guy.</p>
