<p>Hamster has a very short information window and that makes the thinking impossible so he acts with lizard brain (so looses money).
Also random tips or even other hamsters &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; and stuff that is not understandeable as price movement in the moment itself is also not a food for advanced brain so it shrinks its involvement I think and causes what it casuses.</p>
<p>Hunter just has bigger overview and knowledge of the terrain.
So he has traps here and there at fovourable levels.
When he sees some cool landscape maybe he is astonished but he acts within the system that is understandeable and is tested.
That is where higher brain works.</p>
