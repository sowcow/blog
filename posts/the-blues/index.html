  <section><p>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese.
I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea.
I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.</p>
<hr>
<p>The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle.
Most of the time music itself did not attract me.
And that got me interested even more.</p>
<p>Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.</p>
<p>There is both individualism and yet certain communication and understanding.
Also I feel like certain simplicity, freedom and optimism are relevant words.
But I&rsquo;m still divided on the music - gotta practice it more and see.</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood called it own American form of art and that is an interesting nut to crack.
I think I&rsquo;m having something and simple explanations do not work here for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>The part by Wim Wenders seems complex.</p>
<p>I liked how it started - with something that look very open and promising in my eyes.
Of course overexpectations are often unmet.
But it was an interesting part in its own way.</p>
<p>One aspect is about following certain characters stories.
Even though it is not a high-energy content.
I really like biographical content so surely I liked it here.</p>
<p>Then there is social-political aspect.
(These days &ldquo;social-&rdquo; is added everywhere so I felt like it fits there even though I&rsquo;m not sure if the phrase is correct at the time)</p>
<p>My relation here is two-fold.
On one hand I understand the arts changing life for better aspect.
Very cool feeling and probably left deep marks in souls of those involved.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is certain purity of music that possibly is an illusion that I still harbor.
More specifically music by itself evokes something.
And that something is what actually gets me interested.
And any lyrics not to say some socio-political meaning I consider to be distraction from those images.
So I like what it evokes in abstract.
But then making movie about that would be risky or impossible.
And also sometimes it feels like this abstract magic could get dispelled.</p>
