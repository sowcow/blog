  <section><p>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.</p>
<p>Visually and overall I&rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.
But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially.
So one may think that the first thing was there just to
create an illusion of something new.</p>
<p>Anyway actually it was not only for an illusion as I saw as able to hear and see without knowledge of italian.</p>
<p>But anyway I don&rsquo;t think that two topics so different are so easily joinable.</p>
<p>Anyway I liked most of the content in more visual way initially.
Then I went to read libretto and got astonished a bit more.
There is value in watching in more orderly manner than I did.</p>
<p>Also during the visual part I sometimes saw that it is almost like a good time to have a photo.
Not that the content was so &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; to put that into the frame as far as I understand.
But I got to believe that the director planned for certain pace of memorable-enough frames when he constructed the picture.</p>
