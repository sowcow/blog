<p>Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy.
I wanted to write about it but it is not the case
that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics.
Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.</p>
<p>Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs.
Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that.
Even though author mildly argues for that also.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I have good stuff ready to read.
But I fell like I don&rsquo;t have enough focus to commit to it.</p>
<p>On one hand I want to get rid of small things I haven&rsquo;t finished yet.
On the other hand there are good bigger options that require focus/notes.</p>
<p>I have a book with Sun Tzu followed by 5+ other chinese old books.
I really like this content.
The plan is to have some time allocated for actual book reading.
I&rsquo;ll have it with chinese music also :).</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>Overall it looks like this blog is turning into monthly review kind of thing.
I actually considered this use earlier but I envisioned it in more data-based way.
And this still sounds like a good idea.
But the thing that is blocking me from that is that I really want to use own app for that.</p>
<p>And since I mentioned the app here is the status of it.
I started with simplistic ruby (it wasn&rsquo;t smart move).
Because I ended up either reinventing bikes or turning into standard rails+react.
And there is way more exciting idea I&rsquo;m looking into now anyway (gamedev).</p>
<p>Anyway I have a wall calendar for some data accumulation.
So what I have is that I finally started to use my velo among other healthhy habbits.
And this happened in the last week of the month.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is related to COVID-19 uncertaintry.
Or maybe also this idea that I need to write a review soon also contributed.</p>
<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<ol>
<li>General: Let&rsquo;s see if I can keep it with healthy behaviors;</li>
<li>Project: I have a crazy gamedev project idea. I have some simple next-steps and many future ideas of course;</li>
<li>Audio: I really want to try socratic dialogs by audible. They can be demanding but that is the point of it.
Currently there is no alternative that I have in mind for the new month.
Maybe except for german podcasts but I haven&rsquo;t tried them yet;</li>
<li>Video: I have some simple german videos ready to watch/listen.</li>
<li>Text: Sun Tzu+.</li>
