Experiments reveal something about the subject.
Among other things these three definetly have the viewer as their subject too: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut.
Also those movies are talked about more broadly than understood, so this makes for some interesting social experiment.
My observations at this point:

people use different strategies and faculties for solving these movies and it is very contextual
there is almost a protection mechanism around the &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, that is &ldquo;understood&rdquo; by all parties, in part because &ldquo;high&rdquo; is realized in executing those strategies, not in completing the search

I&rsquo;m lately thinking about the idea of shadow archetype-wise very abstractly.
Looking into these dynamics is in a way that shadow area for me." />

<p>I&rsquo;m lately thinking about the idea of shadow archetype-wise very abstractly.
Looking into these dynamics is in a way that shadow area for me.</p>
<p>I consider interpretations of Eyes Wide Shut to be more degenerate than the content at it&rsquo;s deepest.
But the real sewer of interest is the dynamics that produces them.</p>
