  <div class="post-content"><p>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well.
But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially
to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching.
Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn&rsquo;t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.
But actually it was a good movie for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visually I liked this strange palette (no idea if it has a name but I assume it has).</li>
<li>The movie does not contain reading poetry.</li>
<li>It has some comedy and some stuff that seems to be absurd but there should be more precise way to describe it</li>
</ul>
<p>Arthur, the main character is non-ambituous simple man, kind of ignorant about other people.
Probably disillusioned in some sense but having incomplete picture.</p>
<p>Probably by own folly he gets around low quality people and into trouble.</p>
<p>Then by the system he is being put down and executed more for being different.
And even more for not pretending to be like those who populate the system.</p>
<hr>
<p>He does not care much in the beginning of the movie but events force him to experience different affects:</p>
<ul>
<li>love</li>
<li>restlessness</li>
<li>calmess based on deeper understanding of life</li>
<li>and contempt based on ugly lows that humans can reach</li>
</ul>
<p>But he experiences all that too late - soon before he is executed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The character reminds me of myself at different points.</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes I did not pretend where others would do, being more straight forward</li>
<li>I got to be around low quality people at some point</li>
<li>some lack of ambition or vision for the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Although my lack of such kind-of-social smarts is of another nature and I think I have less simpicity (ignorance?) than the Stranger during most of the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p>Interestingly that simpler random people: pimp (afaik), imprisoned arab, a dog owning gentelmen.
They treat Arthur better than those who are part of the system even if rightous and in authority.</p>
<p>So in a way this movie pushes me to redefinde what I consider to be lower quality people.
So even that pimp is a better person than those involved in the execution.</p>
