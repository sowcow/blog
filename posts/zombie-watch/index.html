<p>I do not do hatewatch normally. Also I think I invented a term ugly-watch for this stuff.</p>
<p>No idea why this trash has found its palce an a supposedly patriotical channel.</p>
<p>Anyway watching this stuff can make you think very orwellian stuff is going on.
But one can&rsquo;t assume intention when stupidity can be the case.</p>
