  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="this-time">This time</h2>
<p>So I was about to visit a dentist today.
It was my last visit in this &ldquo;session&rdquo;.
And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.</p>
<p>And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia
it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.</p>
<p>And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.
But I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I will really decide to not use it.</p>
<p>In the end the decision was not that hard.
And I got two obesrviations from it.</p>
<h3 id="1-danger-overrides-pain">1. Danger overrides pain</h3>
<p>(needle + hard to access tooth + recollection ~ danger);
Experimenting thing would not overwrite it in my case. I am not that hardcore.
But it was not danger by itself what informed my decision.
It only kept me from flaking :).</p>
<h3 id="2-middle-ish-intensity-not-long-pain-was-more-like-an-attention-signal-not-like-something-important-at-all">2. Middle-ish-intensity not-long pain was more like an attention signal, not like something important at all</h3>
<p>I was focused on two other things - jaw position and throat state.
So pain was more like a signal to give attention there but there was nothing unexpected anyway.</p>
<h2 id="some-previous-time">Some previous time</h2>
<p>I do not plan to have a series of dentist posts at this point.
But I&rsquo;d like to record previous experiences as well.</p>
<p>One was when I was really affected by it.
So I felt like I&rsquo;m surronded by enemies and every time after they were stopping
I had to remind myself that everybody around is acting in my interests as well.
I probably also was kind of vividly focusing on pain and what exactly they were doing.
And you get some kind of high after it is over.</p>
<p>Another time I got anestesia and it didn&rsquo;t really work.
So I felt it but I was content.
Either because I was relaxed because I expected it to work (and there was nothing else to do anyway).
Or because the nature of that anestesia - but that is unlikely.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>experimenting/relaxed mindset is probably a good idea;</li>
<li>pain fear/avoidance is overrided by expectation of danger;</li>
<li>keeping track of dentist but not focusing exactly on their &ldquo;working area&rdquo; but on other bodily matters instead seems to be a good idea;</li>
</ul>
