  <section><p>So yesterday was the flight and I wanted to put some obvious observations here and mostly comparsion with Virgin Galactic flight about a week ago.</p>
<p>I only go from comparsion point of view because it makes it easy.</p>
<p>So first striking difference was that VG used Mr. Colbert to host the show while BO had some way more serious most of the time.</p>
<p>Altohugh I must say that one comic thing BO show host was doing repeatedly is reminding about Karman line in different ways and one time she even instantly followed Karman line remark with big windows remark.</p>
<p>Anyway BO show was more serious while VG was more chill in aspects like the host choice, gifts choice.</p>
<p>Also another striking moment was that VG show was very personal and individualistic and Mr. Branson was the center of it.
Which was cool and I beleive shows the Virgin approach or Mr. Bransons approach to it - it is for individuals to go for it and they are at the center.</p>
<p>While BO show was more about technology and impersonal and gaining some serious professional-look points.</p>
<p>BO has not shown videos from the inside of the capsule.
I bet many things went not as planned.
Right now I assume they tried to force people to do stuff for camera and things went in unplanned ways.
So they loose some points on being too serious here.</p>
<p><em>UPD: got to see the video from the inside from non-official source, it is ok, at this point I already made my opinion anyway. They released it during post-flight press conference that I didn&rsquo;t watch, it looks like it was alot of conventional talking with conventional these days piano notes playing here and there in between.</em></p>
<p>I like the michievous acheiving spirit of VG founder I hope that his event and the spirit will help and shape experience there.
Also I respect technological acheivement of BO with all cool options it opens there.</p>
<p>Another striking comparsion is that BO looks more extreme. While VG looks more comfortable.</p>
<p>I beleive this more-extreme-event vs more-comfortable and more-available event is going to be the key between choosing one of providers in the near-term.
Even though they both have enough of both aspects.</p>
