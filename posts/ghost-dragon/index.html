<p>Move forward 20 or so years.
And today I saw that kind of dragon in the sky.
I was Big. Kind of in the center above you.
Not a complete version but a convencing one with open jaws.
Then after a minute it disappeared because clouds got dissolved.</p>
<p>It looked more like a bone version but now I see the point why it is upgraded to the ghost version.
Also now it is apparent why in the game it has the lowest HP among dragons.</p>
