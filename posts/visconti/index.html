  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.</p>
<p>I decided to have some stuff written.
Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.
Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.</p>
<h3 id="ludwig">Ludwig</h3>
<p>Very cool.
The key melody is something (Wagner - Song of The Evening Star ).</p>
<p>I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.
I really want to know more about Elisabeth of Austria and Ludwig for sure.
It is possibly rewatcheable for me at some point.</p>
<p>The key conversation I think is about the truth.
The truth distant or &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; versus the truth &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and available.</p>
<h3 id="the-damned">The Damned</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Machiavellian&rdquo; power struggle. Evils of another level but so ordinary and distanced.
So it is like a boiling frog movie where the degree of evil gets higher and higher and sneakily in a way.
So the viewer finds themselves boiled at the end.</p>
<p>To be honest I had to google about the last scene.
So I got it delivered with a delay.</p>
<p>I beleive the director puts multiple evils to the desk at a time.
So when the viewer expects one they are less sensitive to another happened and it sneaks that way.
But then one after another there is a pile of it deposited.
But because that play you didn&rsquo;t expect in the end there to be this much.</p>
<h3 id="conversation-piece">Conversation Piece</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say for some reason.
I guess there are differences so arbitrary that even if they are wast people still have more to share with each other.</p>
<p>My favorite mini-conversation is about modern pictures.
In one russian version it is translated in the worst terms.</p>
<h3 id="death-in-venice">Death in Venice</h3>
<p>Ambiguous. There is a separate post.</p>
<h3 id="rocco-and-his-brothers">Rocco and His Brothers</h3>
<p>Very dramatic.
At the end there is an explanation so you don&rsquo;t need to google :).</p>
<p>It poses a question of &ldquo;sacrafice&rdquo; in a setting where people don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<h3 id="leopard">Leopard</h3>
<p>Lots of aesthetics to see.
About aristocracy that is possibly lost in the new times.</p>
