  <section><p>I&rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.</p>
<p>I decided to have some stuff written.
Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.
Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.</p>
<p>Also I can&rsquo;t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.</p>
<h3 id="ludwig">Ludwig</h3>
<p>Very cool.
The key melody is really something (Wagner - Song of The Evening Star).</p>
<p>I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.
I really want to know more about Elisabeth of Austria and Ludwig for sure.
Also relation of Otto to his mother may be of interest but I beleive the movie just points to that.
It is possibly rewatcheable for me at some point.</p>
<p>The key conversation I think is about the truth.
The truth distant or &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; versus the truth &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and available.</p>
<h3 id="the-damned">The Damned</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Machiavellian&rdquo; power struggle. Evils of another level but so ordinary and distanced.
So it is like a boiling frog movie where the degree of evil gets higher and higher and sneakily in a way.
So the viewer finds themselves boiled at the end.</p>
<p>To be honest I had to google about the last scene.
So I got it delivered with a delay.</p>
<p>I beleive the director puts multiple evils to the desk at a time.
So when the viewer expects one they are less sensitive to another happened and it sneaks that way.
But then one after another there is a pile of it deposited.
But because that play you didn&rsquo;t expect in the end there to be this much.</p>
<h3 id="conversation-piece">Conversation Piece</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say for some reason.
I guess there are differences so arbitrary that even if they are wast people still have more to share with each other.</p>
<p>My favorite mini-conversation is about modern pictures.
In one russian version it is translated in the worst terms.</p>
<h3 id="death-in-venice">Death in Venice</h3>
<p>Ambiguous. There is a separate post.</p>
<h3 id="rocco-and-his-brothers">Rocco and His Brothers</h3>
<p>Very dramatic.
At the end there is an explanation so you don&rsquo;t need to google :).</p>
<p>It poses a question of &ldquo;sacrafice&rdquo; in a setting where people don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<h3 id="leopard">Leopard</h3>
<p>Lots of aesthetics to see.
About aristocracy that is possibly lost in the new times.
Brighter.</p>
<h3 id="bellissima">Bellissima</h3>
<p>(I can&rsquo;t think too straight because of fever but I need to write it to close the topic)</p>
<p>Unnatural world demands and even parents ideas mess with a child.
Either because mother cheats or the girl is not fit for acting from the start and the mother is delusional.</p>
<p>I beleive it is about miscommunication also because
I have this memory of not understanding parents.</p>
<p>Anyway it is about certain dignity of an innocent person.</p>
<h3 id="la-terra-trema">La Terra Trema</h3>
<p>There are many images in the movie that you remember.</p>
<p>While watching it I constantly catch myself thinking: &ldquo;hey! this looks interesting just visually, why are you not paying attention to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So given the movie is black and white random person would not think that it should be visually interesting but it is.</p>
<p>So you constantly see that there is work behind this and even if you don&rsquo;t understand tradeoffs and choices by the director you still perceive the work as having certain quality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this after a couple of days after watching it so lots of thoughts and angles I can&rsquo;t point to now.
One thing that is shown in the movie is that labor in powerty selects for certain character of people and punishes another kind.
I guess it punishes optimists because the cost of risk is too high.
And that selecton opens opportunities for others to exploit such people.</p>
<h3 id="sandra--vaghe-stelle-dellorsa">Sandra | Vaghe stelle dell&rsquo;Orsa</h3>
<p>I got enough for a separate post here!</p>
<h3 id="le-streghe">Le Streghe</h3>
<p>Natural vs artificial vs ugly.
Darker.</p>
<h3 id="boccaccio">Boccaccio</h3>
<p>I remembered it as a fall.
Darker.</p>
<h3 id="lo-straniero">Lo Straniero</h3>
<p>A seperate post is there.</p>
<h3 id="white-nights">White nights</h3>
<p>Nice visually.
I enjoyed the feel of most of scenes being shot inside of a pavilion.
So even sky is artificial.</p>
<p>The story itself I considered to be annoying a bit.
In short random mediocrity gets to see something different and impossible.
Old ways do not satisfy anymore and in part becomes part the of impossible.</p>
<h3 id="senso">Senso</h3>
<p>I have a separate post here.</p>
<h3 id="linnocente--the-innocent">L&rsquo;Innocente | The Innocent</h3>
<p>I wrote about it separatedly.</p>
