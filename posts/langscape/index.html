I didn&rsquo;t read much so my verbal faculty is likely more affected by programming than by stories.
More affected by reflection than by communication.

I assume the text file supports the brain working memory.
That maybe frees some pattern recognition resources.
And recognizing patterns should build the ability to recognize them in general.
So my verbal space is always incomplete at least culturally.

<p>I didn&rsquo;t read much so my verbal faculty is likely more affected by programming than by stories.
More affected by reflection than by communication.</p>
<p>The way I use language in these posts is in a way minimalistic and analytical.
I assume the text file supports the brain working memory.
That maybe frees some pattern recognition resources.
And recognizing patterns should build the ability to recognize them in general.</p>
<p>So my verbal space is always incomplete at least culturally.
And since I started writing these posts it is always in the backlog for potential work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Some background:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got some interesting experience of speech as warfare about two years ago</li>
<li>also got a 1.5 years of consuming &ldquo;good propaganda&rdquo;</li>
<li>got to learn some new language vocabulary</li>
<li>got some courses with tips in the verbal space</li>
</ul>
<p>So I recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>checked around fundamental differences in letters and corresponding sounds</li>
<li>the second time approached A Syntopicon on a very high-level</li>
<li>finally got desensitized and analytical about &ldquo;good propaganda&rdquo;</li>
<li>I even checked one book on improv that had quotes from Anne Frank Diary</li>
</ul>
<p>But also.</p>
<p>I believe there is inertia in peoples verbal spaces.
That is probably related with people learning new languages with religions or with other new values and world-view maybe.
It is interesting how learning new tongue has a promise of getting new eyes.</p>
<p>Anyway if I put my verbal langscape into visual language then it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>province at poisoned berries bushes that invoke trashy and headless humor</li>
<li>some rabbit holes that I&rsquo;m not crossing yet</li>
<li>labyrinth of abandoned constructions with graffities on all walls invoking &ldquo;victory&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Attempting to parse some consistent volume of audio with vocals in another language to see what is there.</p>
