  <section><p>I have just returned from a walk.
On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing.
I tried to look at it and wasn&rsquo;t able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow.
So these &ldquo;golden-hats&rdquo; the church has make it possible to see it even further.
I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.</p>
<p>There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays.
It is complaining-type propaganda on the TV talking about the west for sure.</p>
<p>They have money and certain ugly-type creativity so you get to see interesting stuff.</p>
<p>For example in one show they have one light source in the frame: behind the talking head sitting behind the table and leaning forward.
So it resembles some kind of old-school interrogation with a lamp in your face where all viewers are in that position.
I assume soviet people like that kind of stuff in the more modern setting.</p>
<p>Today the propaganda complaining about the west item was guns in the US.
Given the crime stats here one would assume they should not talk about things like that.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t teach somebody how to make cookies when your are incapable of making your own.
(This odd example I took from a random youtube writer)</p>
<p>But no. In propaganda as in the real life rules are different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plumbers teach making cookies.</li>
<li>Painters complain about laws.</li>
<li>Lawyers talk about pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe there is some kind of absurd aesthetics to it.
I guess I need to watch some absurd comedy because it has more to reality than what I&rsquo;m used to lately.</p>
<p>I believe local propaganda may have opened a new layer of perspective for me when I watch conventional stuff.
But I probably don&rsquo;t have enough attention already while watching stuff.
To also capture that second-level absurd is just like another tool I&rsquo;ll check/see from time to time.</p>
