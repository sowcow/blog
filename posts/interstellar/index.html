  <section><p>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception.
I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try.
So this post is about that experience.</p>
<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with positives to not be too harsh.</p>
<p>The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially.
There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed.</p>
<h2 id="negatives">Negatives</h2>
<p>Well.
It looks like they tried to put all modern movie cliches there and were harsh enough on actors and viewers to also amplify them.
And given already amplified to the limit corny scenes they also added music to amplify and absurdize that even more.
The musician was abused at many points. I refuse to beleive that Nolan was making decisions.</p>
<p>There was one scene (first attachment to the ship) that as I noticed also looked absurd.</p>
<p>Cliches:</p>
<ul>
<li>crying males or in otherwise weak position and then also self-sacraficing</li>
<li>above average sharp females that before you know throw tantrums and try to control males</li>
<li>relations between genders, parent-children and things like that</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I felt that they repeat stuff twice and being too explicit like the target audience is not expected to understand anything.
But since I was rewatching it I can&rsquo;t be sure to evaluate that.</p>
<p>One more thing was that even though I liked some visuals I still somehow found at other times it to be a bit underperforming compared to my expectations.
Strange thing, because I don&rsquo;t beleive that just by passing 7 years the visual side can get outdated.
And I don&rsquo;t normally watch sci-fi to compare.</p>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Some nice things are there.
But considering all the annoying stuff they took into space and put in your face.
That likely ruined the experience for many.
For example than adventure/exploration experience I didn&rsquo;t feel in the movie (but maybe becouse of it was a rewatch).</p>
<p>More objectively speaking the movie is down to earth even though it brings situations in space to reveal things to people.</p>
<p>So I may conseder rewatching Gravity to get what I wanted.
That one even though it has some of that should overall be more detached and therefore more in the space.
No idea about timing though because today I watch Unity22 launch only.</p>
<h2 id="nolan">Nolan</h2>
<p>So here is an excerpt of my older post that touches Nolan.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :).
</code></pre><p>After watching/rewatching 3 of his movies I found everything to be annoying to a different extend.
It is surprising to find that Nolan was so bad on these modern cheesy cliches.</p>
<hr>
<p>One more thing about the movie - after watching it that Murphy law played-out like multiple times for me.
Interesting stuff.</p>
