Instead search got me some parody to his book that has the same name with &ldquo;101&rdquo; added at the end.
There are present actual quotes of Quigley so the book can not be called absolute waste of time.
While of course everything else in it is. Notably:

quotes from Wikipedia
quotes from fiction
own opinions of that 101 author

  <section><p>I&rsquo;ve been checking Audible lately.
It does not make good impression on the outset.
So I decided to search for Quigley there.
Instead search got me some parody to his book that has the same name with &ldquo;101&rdquo; added at the end.</p>
<p>There are present actual quotes of Quigley so the book can not be called absolute waste of time.
While of course everything else in it is. Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>quotes from Wikipedia</li>
<li>quotes from fiction</li>
<li>own opinions of that 101 author</li>
</ul>
<p>The way that &ldquo;author&rdquo; repeats themselves shows how low of an opinion they are about the audience of that &ldquo;book&rdquo;.
So it is that combination where useless author writes for what they obviously see as useless audience.</p>
<p>If Audible got that garbage in stock while not having actual books makes one skeptical of usefulness of that service.</p>
<p>Anyway there are always exceptions so
for now I&rsquo;ve found Iliad by A. Pope and it will take about a month to complete.</p>
<p>I checked the text before.
And my impression is that the text is dense in imagery and reading narrator will by necessity downplay the expression of the text.
So audio version looses qualities therefore it goes as the initial big-picture &ldquo;fast read&rdquo;.</p>
