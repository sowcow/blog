So this is just toying around for the sake of seeing where it leads.</p>
<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>I assume thinking requires certain context being fixed.
So by affecting this context they affect following thinking.</p>
<h1 id="scales-of-storiesthinking">Scales of Stories/Thinking</h1>
<ol>
<li>high-level: geographical: alliances, resources</li>
<li>middle level: normal human thinking in the more understandeable/predictable world</li>
<li>mechanical scale: short-term or magical thinking in unpredictable conditions</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="dehumanization">Dehumanization*</h1>
<p>My guess is that propaganda institutions pollute the middle level
and provide conditions for thinking in other levels.</p>
<h1 id="how-media-must-be-operating-on-levels">How Media Must be Operating on Levels</h1>
<ol>
<li>Statues on the TV performing rituals, high conceptions, limited access</li>
<li>Noise/nonsense, abuse of instincts of subjects</li>
<li>Fear/unpredictability spreading from the media</li>
</ol>
<p>(I bet this is only one of ways to think about that)</p>
<p>(Also there may be different ways of dehumanization, for example
I believe it is dehumanization when subjects thinking attempts are interrupted
by nonsense and sofistry, but that is less relevant now even if pouplar too)</p>
<p>(And maybe there is actual warfare between different such systems)</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-real-world">The Real World</h1>
<p>Given these different levels it is impossibe to have a single &ldquo;true story&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is possible to have &ldquo;good-enough evidence that supports/dismisses stories about facts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So there are competing stories and competing facts.</p>
<p>But also there is the idea about class-warfare and ideology/language
serving that.</p>
<p>So there are competing stories, competing facts and cometing teams on top of that pile.</p>
<p>So politics/media are bound to be a mess if unconstained in their ways.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="on-what-this-reflects">On What This Reflects</h1>
<p>There was a long trip with a taxist with who it
looked like I had an agreement at the time.
But somehow he without really doing anything special but with a couple of random phrases
convinced me that there is more stuff that is going-on.</p>
<p>Previously I gotten to like some more humane direction (that is not cheap or manipulative).
But then some exposure to some other stories moved me away from simple stories.
So things are a mess.
But only this understanding puts me in my place.</p>
<p>I definetly need to use some tools of thinking here.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="upd-9th-of-april-">UPD: 9th of April (*)</h1>
<p>Normally I have a suspicion to langage like that.
Anything de- or anti- is so much likely to be BS or used by confused people.</p>
<p>What I meant above was from a single-brain activity point of view.
But there are other things on different scales.</p>
<p>The question of what is human arises because of that.
And there are so many fake assumptions that the question is not obvious.</p>
<p>One popular naming somebody have came-up with is &ldquo;orcs&rdquo;.
Both funny and having some point naming.
I imagine it becoming offensive and then all related books being banned.</p>
<p>Also there are conformists obviously.</p>
<p>And it was never a secret that different characters exist.
But now since the war-matter is not some arbitrary distinction
that is possible to ignore.
This distinction as it looks now touches human-nature.</p>
<p>Anyway de-humanization conflates meanings of having a human in the first place and then doing some dark magic to them.
And the meaning doing something that in historic terms produces
less humane populations.</p>
<p>The second meaning is what is meant most likely by smarter talking heads.
The first meaning is how subjects should like to see it
because it flatters them and moves-away the responsibility.</p>
<p>And what I mentioned is just an angle to the space of logics and decision-making.</p>
