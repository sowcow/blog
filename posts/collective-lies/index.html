the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it.

<p>So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.</p>
<p>What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points.
It didn't look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan.
And they produce propaganda for their audience.</p>
<p>The problem with ideologies is that they are there for the ruled to beleive in.
And they are not in any way for informed decision making by the free people.</p>
<p>The assumption behind any ideology than uses propaganda (lies, abuse of logic/emotions/attention flaws)
is that the public is low-IQ and it can be used that way.</p>
<p>So it has to be kept that way.</p>
<p>I thought that ideologies are so 20th century.
But then also the data shows that IQ decreaces in some key countries.</p>
<p>So ideologies are still there and with trends like that they are not going anywhere.</p>
