<p>Open libraries are so cool.
They motivate by themselves.
Borrowing and kind-of a limit of time makes the book even more attractive.</p>
<p>Here I just do own notes to review them after I finished reading.
It is not something pretending to have been carefully extracted and distilled.
Sometimes in the process I just do not record stuff, sometimes I record alot more.</p>
<h1 id="the-book">The Book</h1>
<p>Piano, Guided Sight-Reading.
[A New Approach to Piano Study.]
By Leonhard Deutsch.</p>
<p>It can be found and read on openlibrary.org or archive.org.</p>
<h1 id="before">Before</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m subscribed to some quora topics (God forbid reading political stuff there).
And in piano topics email there was a comment on what is the most valuable skill.
And there was a reference to the book.</p>
<p>Also I feel like arts are a necessary language to know and to use. So I pursue this in a way.</p>
<h1 id="after">After</h1>
<p>Interestingly I found stuff to be not as detailedly explained as I wanted.
But this process implies <em>imitation</em> by the student.</p>
<p>Also interestingly teacher is encouraged to learn from student too.
But not piano but pedagogy experience.</p>
<p>Anyway I assume it should be fun and stimulating thing to play around alone too.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>The author is smart.</p>
<p>The author has another book probably on psychology of students for teachers.
(Individual-psychologie im musikunterricht und in der musikerziehung.)</p>
<p>Ear, eye, hands cooperation.</p>
<p>The skill can fit for random enthusiasts who just want to have addittional source of fun and a path do develop misicanship.</p>
<p>Developing the skill requires focusing on accuracy and evenness.
While leaving fluency to be the fruit to be developed.</p>
<p>One developed skill is the ability to have utterly concentrated effort.
That is necessary for the resulting skill.</p>
<p>Three devices of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>rich study material</li>
<li>approaching pianistic tasks/problems</li>
<li>concentrated mental effort</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a memory value for doing music costruction.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the principle of cooperation: listening and playing simoultaneously
(maybe some tool can be used there)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are initial difficulties to overcome first, then the progress is steady</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sight-reading is a stimulating task by itself (gamified by itself?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>harmony, polyphony, form/architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>The musical ear ... is measured by the complexity of the musical structure which he can grasp in all details.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>... infinitesimal shades ... reflect the player's temperament and frame of mind, his maturity and imagination ... whole personality</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="practice-notes">Practice Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>play the selected piece using both hands and in continuity</li>
<li>see both hands staves together</li>
<li>never look at the keyboard</li>
<li>fingers go after the eyes</li>
<li>easy and relaxed tempo, no stumbling or tripping - no metronome, adjust pace when needed</li>
<li>mistakes handling - no process break? correct by ear?</li>
<li>igrone fingering info</li>
<li>both hands strike precisely simoultaneously</li>
<li>even rather soft touch, pay attention to shades of expression</li>
<li>not overly difficult, not non-challenging/non-stimulating at all</li>
<li>choose what can be played slowly and meaningfully (more details in the book)</li>
<li>shorter pieces repeat 3-4, longer: 2 times only or on several consecutive days only
ignoring what degree of perfection is acheived</li>
<li>work on several pieses, varied in style at the same time - stimulating this way</li>
<li>sessions are not too long to have healthy concentration and interest</li>
<li>~1 hour a day will do (implied guided? homeworks - starting from 0.5 to 1 hour, addittionally?)</li>
<li>have a list of pieces and records of practicing with notes (how the piece appeals, difficulties)
review when returning to the piece later (see progress, understanding, taste)</li>
<li>value of accompaniment</li>
<li>most weak students are always on the verge of giving up</li>
<li>during practice: not tired or bored</li>
<li>in the beginning it is a rather strenuous job, but with growing experience you will gain security and ease
your playing will become more and more colorful and fluent, and eventually your practicing hour will be
a source of sheer enjoyment</li>
</ul>
