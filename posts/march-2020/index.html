I started some new healthy behaviors but otherwise there was no acceleration compared to the previous month.
Reading

I have finished small german language book that was laying around for too long
I have started learning a new programming language so I have read a couple of books on it
There are more books on it waiting for their turn

Code

I started playing with a physical engine
I started playing with NNs
Then I lost interest but I&rsquo;m going to return this weekend
because there are other motivating factors

What didn&rsquo;t Work
Sun Tzu realy wasn&rsquo;t right for me. It requires certain state of mind/engagement to read for me. I can&rsquo;t just push through such book so I have put it off for now." />

<p>I have no plan for now. I&rsquo;ll just continue what works.
There is no new thing I would try to incorporate at this point.</p>
