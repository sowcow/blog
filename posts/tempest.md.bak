I've noticed new and unexpected juice-making mashine in the shop I visit periodically.
But also my path to shop goes near a juice-drinking joint that got closed a couple of months ago.

Now since the joint got closed there are dead bugs that seem to accumulate inside.
And it has a very good overview with a wall of glass.
So it is in a way like this big insect aquarium.
It would be entertaining but I don't believe that there is no limit to their accumulation.

Anyway I haven't yet written on A Matter of Life and Death but I was thinking about it and it's potential relation with The Tempest.
Anyway I haven't read The Tempest to confirm.

Today I checked myself against the bent glass of the aquarium wall and saw the ceiling of the place.
It is roughly teal of color and has wires going out grouped from many different points like little lightnings.
It's almost like they got their own frozen artificial tempest there too.
