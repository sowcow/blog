  <section><h1 id="then">Then</h1>
<p>I try to install a habit for reading from time to time.
Previous attempt was Faust that weights 2 kilos because of big format and stylistically different but exceptional pictures on every other page.
Such pictures were competing with images in the text but I enjoyed both.
One notable experience such book can give is when you are trying to analyze through some text
and turn the page and see some unexpected picture.
Then this picture can sink your active attention as some exit that you grasp and appreciate like you would not expect.</p>
<h1 id="now">Now</h1>
<p>I have read How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren.
It is a practical book that keeps you interested.
On one hand it offers a technique of analysis of texts.
On the other hand it also has entertaining bits here and there.</p>
<p>I got some interest in grammar lately.
And I think this interest is one of contributors to reading interest too.
Well written books have a virtue in demonstrating grammatical plays among other things.</p>
<p>Respectable reading list at the end is one of the great features.</p>
<h1 id="paths-forward">Paths Forward</h1>
<p>Also there are pre-made collections that overlap with the reading list.
Gateway to the Great Books has easier and shorter texts/excerpts and it is around 5000 pages.
Great Books of the Western World has a ten years reading plan with it but it has more authors than one would expect.
Also there is Syntopicon for the most demanding but topical paths through books.</p>
<p>In the GBWW I noticed that the choice of translation of Iliad might be not the most exciting;
I&rsquo;m not at the position to judge at this point but likely it was a compromise choice and possibly with accessibility in mind (what implies broad audience and lower barrier for the first read experience).</p>
<p>Ten years plan starts with Plato&rsquo;s Apology.
Given that I have heard it a couple of times,
looking at the first sentence I see the gravity of it.</p>
<p>The Gateway looks too light for my taste, will see how I can handle Plato.</p>
<h1 id="considerations">Considerations</h1>
<p>Of course these days one can not rely on classical books only and one has to mix in the latest scientific findings on topics that have a potential to undo all philosophical books as some say.
But I assume it is not granted that one can see through biases and ideologies so having overview of what was there makes sense.</p>
<p>Also AI can make access to information as available to make reading for information less practical.
Anyway there is ability exercise, certain refined satisfaction and grammatical forms that I&rsquo;m after.</p>
