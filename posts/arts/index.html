Music
Music was one of liberal arts education subjects.
I strongly feel that it is for a reason.
On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it
offers certain hope and positive expectations.
On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.
If being developed I think there can be similarities in perception.
So on the other hand it is as perceptual development as other arts if I&rsquo;m right." />

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Music was one of liberal arts education subjects.
I strongly feel that it is for a reason.</p>
<p>On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it
offers certain hope and positive expectations.</p>
<p>On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.
If being developed I think there can be similarities in perception.
So on the other hand it is as perceptual development as other arts if I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>If that theory is pushed that I guess it is possible for music to have countours.
And then for trees or clouds to have own sounds.</p>
<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>
<p>Also good movies.</p>
<p>Just by watching what director arranged artificially you get to look at things from a fresh angle.
So cool stuff can be found where it is not supposed to be.</p>
