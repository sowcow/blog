Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.
It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.
It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.
Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.
Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.
Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.
Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.
Both in verses and the video on top of them.
This time the experience was without the &ldquo;noise in torn-out ears without head&rdquo; in the process
and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.
Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization." />

  <section><h1 id="path">Path</h1>
<p>Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.
It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.
It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.</p>
<p>Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.
Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.
Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.
Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.
Both in verses and the video on top of them.
This time the experience was without the &ldquo;noise in torn-out ears without head&rdquo; in the process
and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.
Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization.</p>
<p>Then given enough of diversified input irregardless of flashiness or smartness of images this
kind of apex looses it&rsquo;s magics and is understood more as a corner.
Brighter genres are seen with new eyes.
And the reversal of a kind is there.</p>
<p>The turn was crowned by the Chaplin&rsquo;s A Days Pleasure.
It is fun, more than smart and has just enough depth.
The depth is created by different axes and different freedom.</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>I must say that it is a perfect sequence.
The negative apex when seen already from the right context is recalled as interestingly directed right
by incorporating disgust response.
I highlighted only more monumental points in the post and all evaluations are context-dependent.</p>
