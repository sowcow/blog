  <section><p>Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.</p>
<p>Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art.
And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward.
This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.</p>
<p>I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely.
Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does.</p>
<p>So it is a pursuit or exploration of eternal.
Is there a strongest bind?</p>
<hr>
<p>While writing it I remembered what other stuff is there.
Like art being attached to status on one hand.
And on the other hand for example they put a statue of shit in Moscow recently.
And there are those who destroy arts.
So I guess humans foolishness competes to be called eternal too.</p>
