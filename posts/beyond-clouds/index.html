There are some obvious things directors do:

in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds
(so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works)
in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette
you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life
the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers
some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?)
some sounds are distorted in a way that seems like substances are at play but also I somehow associated them with flying still and later when the rain sound is distorted that way it seems more like some natural distortion that humans experience through life
obviousness of some things raises suspicion

I think one should process visuals and speech in parallel to be able to notice most of the things directors do." />

<p>There are some obvious things directors do:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds
(so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works)</li>
<li>in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette</li>
<li>you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life</li>
<li>the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers</li>
<li>some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?)</li>
<li>some sounds are distorted in a way that seems like substances are at play but also I somehow associated them with flying still and later when the rain sound is distorted that way it seems more like some natural distortion that humans experience through life</li>
<li>obviousness of some things raises suspicion</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one should process visuals and speech in parallel to be able to notice most of the things directors do.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more that the second watch should show but I&rsquo;m not sure if this one will attract me again at some point.
The only &ldquo;negative&rdquo; thing about it is that I felt it is really slow for some reason.</p>
<p>I liked a lot of visuals for unknown to me reason.
I start to be suspicious that I&rsquo;m easy to impress visually.</p>
<p>Interestingly one translation to Russian of words of the director is so wildly different from another.
No idea if the original text is so ambiguous and is not in english or if some Russian translator got so creative.</p>
<p>I liked the movie. I liked the theme at the end.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even though I really liked some scenes I want to add that there is some after-feeling.
Sometimes when some content is made to be accessible it just is too obvious.
And I feel like that other directors or whoever else&rsquo;s footprints are there and some authenticity may be lost.
Even though I&rsquo;m just starting with Antonioni I&rsquo;m suspicious about explicidness in this one.
Also this was the last movie where he was one of directors so there is objective basis for this kind of thinking.</p>
