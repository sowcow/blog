  <section><p>I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.</p>
<p>They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean background and possibly interesting lightening</li>
<li>very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!)</li>
<li>modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness)</li>
<li>made in multiple shots</li>
<li>narrative is delivered from this device that runs text</li>
<li>narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands</li>
<li>narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.
But I can forgive them not having that because you can&rsquo;t have so many melodies for every course and then they will start to noticably repeat&hellip;</p>
<p>And given that all I also am subscribed to this trading show and have seen one inteview of one CEO there.
So the CEO wasn&rsquo;t looking like those coaches: all-smiling / polished-looking or otherwise styled / etc.
So one can see none of that stuff and he is more &ldquo;real-world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And then they have shown the stock chart adjacent to his face too&hellip;
Continuing 2020+ pandemic is treating their stock price badly.
It may be too late to short but who know - people with FOMO could jump right-in (just kidding :).</p>
<p>Anyway Later they shown marketing forecast charts to kind of correct the initial impression.</p>
<p>I say imperfection makes it interesting!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more attracted by realness but anyway first I&rsquo;ll try more of those courses to have more complete impression because who knows.</p>
<hr>
<p>Updated thoughts.</p>
<p>There are courses where you have everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>performers know what they do</li>
<li>visual design is definetly there</li>
<li>content is to the point</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>performers are forced to do what they obviously are not able to do</li>
<li>visually things compete for being more stained with each other</li>
<li>very superficial yet diluded content</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case you get to learn more then is explicitly said.
In the second case you are training your patience at best or a fool at worst.</p>
<p>And in this case I obviously go for higher quality.
What I meant by more raw and real-world is also quality but it is different.</p>
<p>When I see low quality almost by intent on a platform with stuff that also has content that respects some standards I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>A bad product is a bad product.
Is there a paid feature to remove all the lower quality stuff?</p>
