  <section><p>One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was.
First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background.
Now I decided to try another one and you guess what.
It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits.
Then it contrasts it by some piano notes.
But anyway I have no idea what to think about that.</p>
<p>Concerning the movie. It shows that it is a different movie right from the first scenes (if we ignore that credits occurance).
It immediately starts talking to you with images and jestures.</p>
<p>I loved the absurd scenes, I found them to be extremely fun.
So it is definetly my kind of movie.</p>
<p>Some impressive shots and atmospheric sequences of course.
Rewatch value.</p>
<p>Notable symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>vase/lamp</li>
<li>propeller/fan</li>
<li>fences (possible chain too)</li>
<li>movement: folliage, water</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume water flowing away in the end means ending and that ugly sound is how empty barrel sounds.</p>
<hr>
<p>Definetly rewatch value is there.</p>
<p>Just random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>vase - initially I thought about pregnancy, maybe just emptiness overall?</li>
<li>fans - noisy meaninless perpetual movement that changes nothing? while plane is expectation of something else maybe (possibly Antonioni reuses symbols of own or tradition)</li>
<li>fat statue (again pregnancy?)</li>
</ul>
