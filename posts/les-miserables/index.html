  <div class="post-content"><p>On the outside it is a music box that is visually tasty and theatrical.
When you open it you are there for multitude of melodies of crying among other serious and humorous lines.</p>
<p>This may make an impression of some femininity aspect
or certain serious non-seriousness, naivete and oversimplification/cliche-even
or even offensive to somebody&rsquo;s perception of normal and mirror-neurons abuse.</p>
<p>Offended crowd is not the one worth listening to
but still perception of such toys may need the right mindset that they don&rsquo;t possess.</p>
<p>It can be perceived that often some personal boundaries or concern for status is missing.
This allows the director/author to show some unusual drama openly/closely.</p>
<p>Concerning serious lines the biggest character conflict is between
Javert and Valjean.
Both are driven by their drama and both possess character more than would be rational to have.
So they are principled.
Javert represents the static/order side and his tower collapses in the end.
Valjean represents dynamic/adaptable side and he starts new life every now and then and even after his death.</p>
<p>Concerning humor the funny crooks couple is the entertaining bit in that too-serious and dramatic world.</p>
<p>There are lots of low-life behaviors in general. Different martyrdom too.
And I&rsquo;m not a fan of any martyrdom given how it plays out for worthy and principled individuals
in Belarus and Russia.
On the one hand the plot does not give too much of false promise when the revolution is crushed.
On the other hand it still may look like it offers something unclear in the end.
But I assume it is to close the music box on a positive note for it&rsquo;s function is complete then.
And probably this puts the positive song into the memory to hold as a summary.</p>
<p>Another lacking thing it seems intelligence too.
Probably Javert and the state represented it.
Probably times were so unreasonable and the state was failing too.
The movie probably highlights value of faith in it&rsquo;s core sense in such times.</p>
