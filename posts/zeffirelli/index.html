Romeo and Juliet
I&rsquo;m not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.
I liked the main theme.
And some scenes for sure.
And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.
One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected).
And when it is over there is like a relief somehow.
But the next day afterglow is quite nice." />

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I liked the main theme.
And some scenes for sure.
And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.</p>
<p>One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected).
And when it is over there is like a relief somehow.
But the next day afterglow is quite nice.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like overly dramatic suicide stuff for sure.
And when they do it quick like there is a train they don&rsquo;t want to miss.
Or when they use steel.
This incurs disbelief if you ask me.
But the stuff is not supposed to be realistic or overglorified so such messy scenes are the price to pay for exaggregation of the story.</p>
