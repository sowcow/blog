<p>So I got alot of not-easily to reconcile experience that is not cheep also.</p>
<p>Anyway gotta write some my levelup thoughts so I remember them better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unexpected stuff happens at any time and in any combinations. Gotta learn and be ready (chosen strategy) from the decision point.</li>
<li>it is about strategy choice from options and then appropriate execution plan and execution and not about any price moves at all</li>
<li>margin is a wild thingy, I&rsquo;m not used to that now but gotta improve :) also one should be able to ignore price movements and forget about the account money (and potentially have more cash to compensate for it if negative news coming-out)</li>
<li>intraday requires back-testing and knowledge of probabilities and stop-loss distance is a crucial part of it
and actualy automated system I think (so is not really an option outside of some obvious &ldquo;rockets&rdquo;)</li>
<li>other than intraday holding without margin is easy thing to do but take profits should be automated</li>
<li>entry also should be distributed over a period where you want to flatten price movements and completely ignore them</li>
<li>manipulations or unexpected stuff happens so one cannot be unprepared to anything</li>
<li>if you watch at the price charts forget ease and comfort irregardless of where the price goes</li>
<li>it is like a work - you need to be on time on crucial points and be ready (also timeboxed decision making, not random urgent stupid actions)</li>
<li>in a way being serious and methodical works I beleive but also being open-minded for unexpected stuff is a necessary part of it! Because otherwise you are easily manipulated and predicted as the rest of the crowd.</li>
<li>deciding exit goal and exit points before putting a trade
and deciding on entry process relaxes you thinking alot.</li>
<li>fresh and not confused brains are a resource - don&rsquo;t overtrade</li>
<li>any sign of lack of self-control is a sign of confused brains so access ot investments should be closed at that time!
(like impulsive buying idea or other indulgent state of mind)</li>
<li>read books on stuff - they give useful small related advices</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t listen to anybody - even if they are right today it is unbeliveably foolish to act on something outside of your understanding</li>
<li>But don&rsquo;t be disconnected from actual news and don&rsquo;t miss the first hour when they play-out in case you use margin for sure</li>
<li>The best way to use margin is to close it scalp/speculatively I think</li>
<li>The easiest and profitable thing too is to just make nice bets that have to be automatically fulfilled on money you can forget that exists without use of margin.
(I still am not good at margin I beleive it can be used in an uptrend to buy corrections, temporaly maybe, but then you can enter some odd-decisions area that I honestly don&rsquo;t want to get experienced at but I feel like I need to get the experience to not have a fear of it. So buying on margin adds complexity for me at this point)</li>
<li>diary or just a sticker card planning of your investment and its outcome and exit points is necessary, also some justification of why it looks like a good investment and why risks can be &ldquo;ignored&rdquo;.</li>
<li>hamsters loose on any movement of the price either up or down so for them it is best to avoid following it at all</li>
</ol>
<p>You always &ldquo;loose&rdquo; somethnig. If not money then opportunities.
So it is not &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also very rare opportunities works but require stable mind-set.
So when on russian session MM decides to take-off stop-losses and moves price down it is easy money right there if you care enough to put an order and buy!</p>
<p>Overall there is something characteristic about this experience for me.
I feel like it really is about being badass in a way, being in a very clear non-emotional state.
I respect that and want to be part of it.</p>
