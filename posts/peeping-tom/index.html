<p>I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago.
It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.</p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>many things at once is how I see it</li>
<li>the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating</li>
<li>lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious</li>
<li>it succeeded at confusing me at points surely</li>
<li>effect: not scared but puzzled
(which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis)</li>
<li>high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes,
different personalities,
direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or
you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there;</li>
<li>fearless desensitized vs fearless normal</li>
<li>magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably</li>
<li>topic of desensitization by the industry</li>
<li>enjoyed accents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though
there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling
but the director did his work
by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect;</li>
<li>the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things
and producing effects, &ldquo;things perceptable and the general level
is not distracting your from products&rdquo;,
so there should be rewatch value from that for sure;</li>
<li>it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad
so you have your time to think about stuff,
I liked that for sure,
yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material;</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="exceprts">Exceprts</h1>
<p>That &ldquo;he is the director&rdquo; I understood it (but not at that moment)
as both:</p>
<ul>
<li>some interesting humor about the way
the director says &ldquo;action!&rdquo; in a way confusable with sneezing</li>
<li>that the director is not recognized (see part about the initial sequence)</li>
</ul>
<p>One key scene: breaking window and cops hiding say: &ldquo;- It is just a camera. - Is it?&rdquo;.
(I think aggressiveness of camera mentioned by Scorsese stems from
this scene and the question asked by the director directly)</p>
<h2 id="ending-interpretation">Ending Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the end he found a new subject of interest for him,
but in order to acheive perfect focus and stillness
he uses his camera again to finish the picture.</p>
<p>Another life traded for the right effect produced,
collected at extremes, screaming for attention,
focused and amplified by cameras.</p>
<h2 id="public">Public</h2>
<p>After watching it I got to check comments on a popular site and
they can&rsquo;t be reacted upon other than by the phrase &ldquo;this is hopeless!&rdquo;.
Also given that the movie was initilly taken-down by public and
how that affected director&rsquo;s career.
I like to think that the director reserved the
honorable place of the initial sequence for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>the standards of public are not different from ones of that prosutitute: how much cash is in it?</li>
<li>public is incapable to recollect what they have seen and unable to recognize the director like the grimacing lady on the stairs;</li>
<li>the trash bin where director throws packaging form the used film
is where public opinions belong;</li>
</ul>
<p>In this light it would be actually scary for public
to see themselves through mirrors in the directors camera.</p>
