Some things should not be played because they can&rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe.
But probably I&rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.
Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.
Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.
I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning." />

  <section><p>Watched it without subtitles or anything.
Actually didn&rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.</p>
<p>Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand.
I&rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example.
Some things should not be played because they can&rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe.
But probably I&rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.</p>
<p>This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.
Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.
Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.
I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning.</p>
<p>Also I normally don&rsquo;t know how to understand vocal.
But maybe recent listening to Callas and different operettas has altered that.
So I enjoyed initial aria by Domingo and I definetly relistened one part by Obrazcova.</p>
<p>Side note. Lately I try to surround myself more with well-placed voice.
I got one cool idea about that but probably audio-books are the way.
I just need to organize my routine to have that reliably.</p>
<p>Back to the main part. One aspect I found interesting about the picture is that it is likeable dispite being a tragedy.
It applies to empathy all the time in different ways but it still I believe has a class.
Maybe this is just the name of the director that alters my view in such way.
Maybe it is me being so detached because of lack of verbal information.
Or maybe I need to figure-out what else is there.</p>
<hr>
<p>One thing I should add is that I&rsquo;m curious if there is alternative realization of the opera with more sicilian character of the Santuzza. That should be interesting to see too.</p>
