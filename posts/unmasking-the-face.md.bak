# Context

There is a breaking of the forth wall element in theater/cinema.
I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools.
For example in Killer's of the Flower Moon there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth walls
and one obvious in the end.
I'd say even if sneaky they signify key moments to consider.

For whatever questionable reason I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently.
Somehow the director even if the he has great work, tends to be mentioned by russian speaking people who have no idea about cinema but want to make a shade of impression.
Anyway Perfect Days also has one sneaky and one less so instances of breaking of the forth wall.
So Wenders finally pushed me to get a book on mimics and facial expression.
And Chat-GPT gave good advice on the specific book.

# Book

Another context is that I planned to consider comedy this year so one title is Black Adder.
Rowan Atkinson image makes this impresison that he is the one who makes strangest facial expressions.
He would be humbled if he saw what expressions Paul Ekman the author of the book has produced.
He made a lot of direct photos of facial expressions and cut them apart in recomposable way.
Those recomposed ones are the strangest and the most humorous too if you ask me.

Talking about quality in general.
I've enjoyed the no-BS descriptive language of the author.
The approach to the subject matter is also very logical and makes sense.
I need some deliberate practice to be able to make some concluding remarks on it.
