  <meta name="description" content="There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way.
I&rsquo;m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.
The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.

First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued;
Second when he revives the diva;
Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking;
And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;

I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it&rsquo;s place.
The name suggests that too. Maybe I should just read the list of all plots finally so I don&rsquo;t need to analyze but maybe something is lost then." />

<p>The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.</p>
<ul>
<li>First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued;</li>
<li>Second when he revives the diva;</li>

<p>I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it&rsquo;s place.
The name suggests that too. Maybe I should just read the list of all plots finally so I don&rsquo;t need to analyze but maybe something is lost then.</p>
<p>In the beginning the protagonist is being dismissed by the La Scala judges and it is their normal game as Rossi told him.
Then status difference is highlighted both by Nadina and the monarch.</p>
<p>The protagonist dismissed La Scala.
Conquered the diva and took her from the monarch.
While also helping to take the course of the country too.
And then went after establishing a non-profit in that emerging domain.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is also emotional part of the movie where you see different female roles that played their part and succeeded too.</p>
<p>Also one thing I like to think about the plot is that Rossi has staged the story of young admirer returning the diva completely. Or maybe Arturo smartly made-up his story. Somehow I like to have an acceptable lie in this to keep it to the spirit of the scene.</p>
