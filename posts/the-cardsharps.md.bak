I have experienced the sudden escalation effect of the picture.
I wonder if background information and other pictures influenced that experience too or the picture is self-contained.

I assume this picture for me has opened the door for other works of the author. I wonder if it casts a shadow too.

# Spoilers

- the artist was involved in stabbing a person to death over gambling matters
- english naming of picture sounds sharp
- other paintings too often have or imply sharp objects
