My verdict is that it&rsquo;s interestingly made but unconceptual as it is, so the peak is not even in the ballpark.
It does not mean the viewer can&rsquo;t find interesting allusions or some detachment in the show&rsquo;s atmosphere.
At one point I felt that atmosphere could have certain value as if TV turned into a fireplace and people watching it could have some common mystery experience." />

<p>It does not mean the viewer can&rsquo;t find interesting allusions or some detachment in the show&rsquo;s atmosphere.
At one point I felt that atmosphere could have certain value as if TV turned into a fireplace and people watching it could have some common mystery experience.</p>
<p>But otherwise taking Lynch any seriously is an error.
I&rsquo;ve felt so disgusted by first pages of his book that I always assume anything by him is a fraud of a kind.
If in tragedy you have the tragic flaw of a character, then this fraudulence is the comic flaw in the entertainment industry.
There must be something very American about it too, I can&rsquo;t allocate language more precisely about it.</p>
