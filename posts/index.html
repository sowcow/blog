    <h2>Peeping Tom</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Spoiler alert and all that.
I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago. It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.
Key points  many things at once is how I see it the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious it succeeded at confusing me at points surely effect: not scared but puzzled (which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis) high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes, different personalities, direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there; fearless desensitized vs fearless normal magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably topic of desensitization by the industry enjoyed accents  Quality  all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling but the director did his work by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect; the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things and producing effects, “things perceptable and the general level is not distracting your from products”, so there should be rewatch value from that for sure; it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad so you have your time to think about stuff, I liked that for sure, yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material;  Exceprts That “he is the director” I understood it (but not at that moment) as both:...</p>

    <h2>Toothpaste of Wisdom</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>My tooth pase every day recommends me to save water. The problem is that I have a couple of bottles saved and they stand on a visible place too.
So I follow trends and all that but my paste keeps demanding more…
So I thought what if I buy not the cheap paste but some premium version, will the banner disappear? Or at least can I get a better more premium-customer advice then?...</p>

    <h2>Demoralization by Example</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are different meanings of demoralization that I’m aware of:
 Bezmenov meant total war by exporting ideologies that wipe-out moral reference-points and cause fracturing and internal conflict. Arestovich was talking about waves-like dynamics, I assume due to bio-chemistry that is more cyclical and maybe caused by strong stimuli in the first place (interestingly I got some of that observed by myself)  There should be more for sure but I like the interesting ones and I got this idea that some signal demoralization (non-consuciously like most of things surely) as some kind of warfare against mirror-neurones of others....</p>

    <h2>Information Warfare</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I haven’t read anything on this. So this is just toying around for the sake of seeing where it leads.
General I assume thinking requires certain context being fixed. So by affecting this context they affect following thinking.
Scales of Stories/Thinking  high-level: geographical: alliances, resources middle level: normal human thinking in the more understandeable/predictable world mechanical scale: short-term or magical thinking in unpredictable conditions  Dehumanization* My guess is that propaganda institutions pollute the middle level and provide conditions for thinking in other levels....</p>

    <h2>Katastrofa</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>A week ago walking through some mazes in Belgrade I found a barbershop for myself. Family business, very authentic place and people. What a luck!
Anyway initially I thought one of the hostesses called my haircut on the photo in the passport a “katastrofa”. Now I’m thinking it was not about the photo or maybe it was.
It was fun and I enjoyed the experience there. Now I’m thinking about communication and more....</p>

    <h2>Democracy</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>As I understand today the notion is applied to anything where elections are not obviously bought/stolen/taken by force.
And I have an impression that this word has really big halo not only among the demos but also part of some basic assumed ideology of talking/thinking classes.
Obviously it is too subvertable to be anything that can be called “good”. But the recent war shows that in competition against more “archaic” system it wins (as it looks now)....</p>

    <h2>Wing/Mind</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Overall I avoided flying before. So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.
I have this anchored to the planes wing.
When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me. And that was not very comfortable mode.
Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me....</p>
