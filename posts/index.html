    <h2>Contrast</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days. It can be summarized this way: I didn’t beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter. And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that. But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.
Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view....</p>

    <h2>Half Watch</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).
It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.
Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.
I think that it works this way:...</p>

    <h2>Sparrow</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well. Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing. And that I’m not the right audience for the theme overall. And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.
During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work. At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet....</p>

  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say… I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas…
I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.
Pros:
 Some nice shots are present Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there  Cons:
 pace is not for me messy so called “psychological” stuff about characters being unhappy and all that does not attract me ugly sounds play from time to time  Notables:...</p>

    <h2>Ivory Tower</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.
They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
 clean background and possibly interesting lightening very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!) modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness) made in multiple shots narrative is delivered from this device that runs text narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material…  The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there....</p>

    <h2>The City</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don’t have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.
Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between. I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I’m here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place....</p>

    <h2>Stocks3</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Approach So I’m excited about my third approach of the market. It is different from the previous ones.
The latest thinking is that margin is by default is not going to be used at all.
I have an interesting idea to start with “paper-trading” and then introduce cash gradually (with randomness actually to even not know the size of the position first to be more chill). Actual paper-trading should address the greed to jump into the last wagon and be more chill....</p>

    <h2>The Adventure</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.
Anyway visually I’m just too easy to impress so I liked many “shots”.
There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.
I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode…...</p>

    <h2>Rhytm</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Since I’m exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.
I bet there are good scientific theories but I’m too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:
 social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not  ...</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Clouds</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I definetly liked some scenes most notably driving throug fog.
There are some obvious things directors do:
 in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds (so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works) in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?...</p>
