    <h2>Mind of the Raven</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I decided to finally check on how smarter animals organize their groups. I decided to start with ravens because they came to the mind recently. This one was the first that came-out of the google although I know there is a recommendation on this kind of books that I need to dig-out.
I’m in the beginning and there is that feeling that I’m not going to be told anything organizational. Because the book goes into details on peculiar stuff that is cool from another point of view....</p>

    <h2>The Blues</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
 The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves....</p>

    <h2>Otto E Mezzo</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with....</p>

    <h2>Pagliacci</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.
Visually and overall I’m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don’t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new....</p>

    <h2>Cavalleria Rusticana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn’t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I’m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can’t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I’m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well....</p>

    <h2>Sunday Propaganda</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have just returned from a walk. On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing. I tried to look at it and wasn’t able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow. So these “golden-hats” the church has make it possible to see it even further. I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.
There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays....</p>

    <h2>Meet Joe Black</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see the good quality there. There is class I believe too.
One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I’m used to capture but it is definetly visible.
The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.
Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish. At some points you may think: “What kind of dialogs are these?...</p>

    <h2>12 Registi per 12 Citta</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched some of it. I’ll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.
Other The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.
The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure. (I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn’t really live through that time....</p>

    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>

    <h2>The Righteous Mind</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Found-out that scribd has some good stuff that I wanted to check like this title. So I got over first three chapters in audio format. Looking at how it goes I would switch to the short version in this case.
 Don’t eat while listening to it because the author does alot of stuff in the beginning for sure. I think consciously but who knows; Even though narrated by the author the experience is very copy-paste/so-conventional from the execution point of view....</p>
