    <h2>Wing/Mind</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Overall I avoided flying before. So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.
I have this anchored to the planes wing.
When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me. And that was not very comfortable mode.
Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me....</p>

    <h2>Special Operation</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Heat On one hand the topic is heated so it is not advised for polite discussion. On the other hand there is some insight to extract.
Naming The scope of what is called “special operation” actually is nuclear. One can say that it is an invasion or war - expecting the worse. But also this can be something addittional to that - one move in some combination on the geopolicial landscape....</p>

    <h2>City Lights</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Some Context Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems. Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out. So the opportunity to do that was realized.
Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon. And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop. So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.
City Lights Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.
Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting....</p>

    <h2>Olympics Circus</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.
But I didn’t expect that people would do worse and voluntary. That error of underestimating idiocy and comedy of real-life I should stop committing.
Anyway some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.
At least now I know that the game is not as demanding physically and oxygen-wise as I thought. But also everybody got entertained by this new equipment....</p>

    <h2>L&#39;oro Di Napoli</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This is not the first time I see this. But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used. It makes things more understandable and more like communication.
So I liked how director emphasises certain places. That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience. Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.
Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed....</p>

    <h2>Olympics</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In Russian to cheer for the team can be directly translated into english as “to be ill for”.
I found it amusing when a reporter from Olympics in China said that “We are still being ill here”.
Also between that it is very patriotic to show some soviet technological developments/acheivements that were not pursued after the fall. So that people feel the dark sorrow for the glorious past and resentment toward ideological enemies....</p>

    <h2>Entropy</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Digital world incentives makes for some odd-looking entropy.
Things at one point can be quite good. But then they don’t grow in understandeable sense - they may still have some reason to be attractive on one side on another side they just devolve and get stupider and uglier for no meaningful reason.
So you get this mixed bag. And there is something like loss-aversion or switching cost. Which I think is a costly intuition in these matters....</p>
