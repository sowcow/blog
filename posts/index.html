    <h2>Beyond the Clouds</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I wanted to visit this one for the second time.
There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not. It is very satisfying to see the director’s play and then he confirms it too.
That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested. It is a funny scene on the first look.
Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes....</p>

    <h2>Three Names</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time. Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website. The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.
one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that next is the English version of the name; but I’m not from England or the US Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion....</p>

    <h2>Black Swan</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve been listening to the book little by little. And I there are some interesting ideas in the book. One idea as I recall it is that if a war goes for one year, assume it will go for another year; if it goes for two years then assume additional two.
So first I got to think about unpredictability of finishing wars. Then the next day some reality-show coup grabbed everybody’s attention....</p>

    <h2>Et in Arcadia ego</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I’ve got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately. Then I’ve read some Gombrich and there he features the painting. The painting straightened me up a bit.
Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself. This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.
Picture I enjoyed the piece for sure. If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findings then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well....</p>

    <h2>Three Holes</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I didn’t plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially. But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day. In fact I’ll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.
So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to....</p>

    <h2>La Dolce Vita</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Rich movie, unforgettable images Lots of echoes inside Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time. Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.
Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie....</p>

    <h2>River</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Previously I had this assumption that the most valuable language to learn must be most different from the native tongue. Now while learning some Serbian I got to see that learning similar language has it own advantages. Because of similarities it is easier to see parallels and to reflect back on parts of the native language that you were not aware of. And even though actual etymology may be not as straight-forward as it seems, the current picture of a language matters....</p>

    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg. I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.
First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it. Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can’t unsee it. This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be. Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them....</p>
