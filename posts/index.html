    <h2>Matter of Life and Death</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.
Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.
Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and “flight from Berlin”. Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.
There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored....</p>

    <h2>Wired Encounters</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I was looking for a project this summer so I had some random interactions over the internet. Two of interactions had some strange quality.
One is what I recall as short and bald guy from post-Soviet territory. He had a very attentive look as if at every moment he was looking at spinning slots. He had a gambling project and he even said that involvement in such projects is less ethically challenging than being involved in prostitution business....</p>

    <h2>Tempest</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve noticed new and unexpected juice-making machine in the shop I visit periodically. But also my path to shop goes near a juice-drinking joint that got closed a couple of months ago.
Now since the joint got closed there are dead bugs that seem to accumulate inside. And it has a very good overview with a wall of glass. So it is in a way like this big insect aquarium. It would be entertaining but I don’t believe that there is no limit to their accumulation....</p>

    <h2>Black Narcissus</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>It is a type of lucid Disney movie crossing into a horror film. The earliest erotic movie. Melodrama about nuns.
Spoilers may lie ahead.
Team In director’s commentary M. Powell mentions:
high quality of the team and art department cases of intrinsic match of actors to roles directors role of believing in the project how the team kind of lived through the movie (without big picture possibly?) And this final point probably assumes a degree of improvisation on actors part in the process and also a degree of freedom during the editing part....</p>

    <h2>Eyes Wide Shut</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context Even though I’ve seen some of this director and I recall some things to be interesting I otherwise avoided watching his work because the name seemed too popular. Checked this one for a random reason. I wasn’t sure about the choice for the first half maybe. But then the director delivered technically. And then I got to see the conception that is brilliant too.
Summary Delivered in colorful and crinkling packaging to distract the viewer; simultaneously Christmas and Halloween joke played right on the viewer; yet also having a personal down to earth snapshot of not obvious family business management at one point....</p>

    <h2>The Cardsharps</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have experienced the sudden escalation effect of the picture. I wonder if background information and other pictures influenced that experience too or the picture is self-contained.
I assume this picture for me has opened the door for other works of the author. I wonder if it casts a shadow too.
Spoilers the artist was involved in stabbing a person to death over gambling matters English naming of picture sounds sharp other paintings too often have or imply sharp objects ...</p>

    <h2>Der Himmel über Berlin</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there. After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.
On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights. And this sets the standard and expectation. So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used. But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact....</p>

    <h2>Langscape</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Langscape I didn’t read much so my verbal faculty is likely more affected by programming than by stories. More affected by reflection than by communication.
The way I use language in these posts is in a way minimalistic and analytical. I assume the text file supports the brain working memory. That maybe frees some pattern recognition resources. And recognizing patterns should build the ability to recognize them in general.
So my verbal space is always incomplete at least culturally....</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Clouds</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).
There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not. It is very satisfying to see the director’s play and then he confirms it too.
That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested. It is a funny scene on the first look.
Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes....</p>

    <h2>Three Names</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time. Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website. The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.
one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that next is the English version of the name; but I’m not from England or the US Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion....</p>
