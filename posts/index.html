    <h2>Polar Positions</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions. While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.
It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance. Operational democracy is a demanding beast.
Note My view on this stuff is always very confused. So I highlight some aspects that look new to me but since I don’t have a bigger picture yet there is a higher risk of misinterpretation and inherent vagueness of statements....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>On a crossroads if lights show me green before I get there - I skip this turn regardless of how much time is there. It doesn’t sound like a “herd behavior” on one hand. But unusually this leads to me crossing the road with a crowd on every crossroads this way.
Anyway if it shows me green, instead I go check the newspapers I never check or I find something interesting....</p>

    <h2>Loading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>After getting excited by New York Stories. I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.
I say it can’t be other way. Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind. So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors....</p>

    <h2>New York Stories</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Talking about the first segment here. Awesome and controversial piece. Watching this only one time is not getting the value. And general context of watching should be different too so I&#39;d recommend arbitrary time gap between sessions. Also spoilers here may spoil the second watch too.
 The first segment of New York Stories is by Martin Scorsese. I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still....</p>

    <h2>Apology</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Overview Best known piece where Plato poses big question vividly. The question touches many topics and can be seen from different angles. Humor lightens the reading while also bringing Socrates closer thus increasing the gravity of the question.
Angles obvious to me:
 character vs shadows duty vs whatever high cost of truth vs mass of conformists individual ethics vs median masses mechanics/(im)morality political/ideological: “undemocratic logic” of considering what is best as opposed to wherever masses go political/class: rich young followers intergenerational and other decay/corruption of Athens inadequate court process, circus by definition  Unforgettable quote: “by the dog I swear!...</p>

    <h2>How to Read a Book</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Then I try to install a habit for reading from time to time. Previous attempt was Faust that weights 2 kilos because of big format and stylistically different but exceptional pictures on every other page. Such pictures were competing with images in the text but I enjoyed both. One notable experience such book can give is when you are trying to analyze through some text and turn the page and see some unexpected picture....</p>

    <h2>The Moon</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In the morning I looked at the the Moon movement against the horizon, spire and the clear sky. I assume stars could be similarly useful background too.
Movement perception and image perception are somewhat different systems as scientific evidence established and that idea is already entertaining by itself. But the subjective experience has it’s own weight.
And if you are me then surely you would have five interesting hypotheses about how your movement vector could have been biased and start writing about it until evidence shows to reasonable degree that it wasn’t....</p>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings. They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.
In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein. I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.
First is obviously similar short form.
Second is political angle. As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time....</p>
