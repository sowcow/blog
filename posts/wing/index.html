  <div class="post-content"><p>Overall I avoided flying before.
So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.</p>
<p>I have this anchored to the planes wing.</p>
<p>When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me.
And that was not very comfortable mode.</p>
<p>Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me.
More preferable, not really escapist/non-productive or confusing I think.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got to think about another such mode.
Like a confusion that still can be directed and having it&rsquo;s own &ldquo;program&rdquo; on some level.</p>
<p>Talking about confused there is also more shallow and kind of externally confused mode.</p>
<p>Anyway do I have a synthesis of this?</p>
<p>I expect there to be value in the ability to discern these and to navigate them.
I assume any mix that does not have the &ldquo;confused&rdquo; part should be great.</p>
<p>One very abstract idea would be to bring technical stuff closer somehow and bring oneself into
to have the first mode. I imagine it like a Mario game that is actually gamified coding for example.</p>
<p>Concerning the second mode I think it is about having enough own or learned experience.
Maybe improving ability in asethetics or pattern recognition can be helpful.</p>
<p>And the confusing ones need external culture/system/tools or training by definition.</p>
