  <section><p>I liked how the picture was made; it is necessary to see it from that perspective.
But as it happens when the viewer reduces the picture to their own level of thinking,
I shall proceed and make this post about alcohol in movies I saw relatively recently.</p>
<p>There is so much alcohol in Casablanca that movie disc boxes should be tagged with excise taxes.
I don&rsquo;t know if that final bottle drop has any subconscious effect from that perspective,
but I observed some dynamics in my own relation to alcohol that was changing with the level of conscious understanding of other pictures.</p>
<p>I bet Jack having drinks in the bar scene from The Shining made Stephen King&rsquo;s mouth dry.
Despite the kind of reduced look of Jack in that scene,
I myself got an idea to maybe check the brand, even though it is not my thing in any way.
Then when I got to made 2+2 about different details of different scenes,
I found strong negative reinforcement against alcohol instead.
But I think it only worked when I found things consciously.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that movie is both an ad and anti-ad, depending on the level of detail you see.</p>
<p>Another picture is Cape Fear.
I don&rsquo;t believe it features any ad-like alcohol scenes, which is good.
But then if you look across, considering either both movies, or book background, or otherwise got enough of the second layer solved + general human thing,
then you could interpret the final scene with alcohol in mind as one aspect of reality packed into the scene.
If you can see that, then it&rsquo;s negative reinforcement on par with The Shining.</p>
<p>Anyway, I lost interest in trying brands or anything at all.
What got my attention is that the effect required conscious recognition/interpretation.
So my own sample suggests that recognition at a conscious level is a requirement for virtuous advertisement or propaganda.</p>
<p>From this perspective I should interpret Casablanca as a long road out of the bar by Rick.</p>
