  <div class="post-content"><p>All similarities are accidental.
All characters are fictional and have no relation to the real world.</p>
<p>I was reading one book on in a way advanced <code>ruby</code>. And since I know that the ruby community can be quite good the standard
of expectations was quite high on my part.
I imagine in my mind that the book is by somebody who also is a library writer.</p>
<p>So it definetly starts with some good stuff from the logics point of view.
I enjoy learning such bits that make things clear.</p>
<p>But then I encountered that most of the text is a counter-revolution against that simplicity.</p>
<p>First I started to notice this pattern: the author creates an imaginary problem
like something must be &ldquo;non-performant&rdquo;.
And then starts to turn ruby into some monstrous thing with different moves.
But then finally he finds flaws in the latest ugly solution so it is rejected too.</p>
<p>Those moves definetly bring alot of code examples and thus book volume.
And I&rsquo;m aware that such moves have exploratory education value in theory.
But the pattern from &ldquo;good&rdquo; things to ugly things for arbitrary reasons is counter-intuitive and counter-ruby I&rsquo;d say.
I have not checked for better ways to present such explorations I only state some annoyance
and reasoning behind it.</p>
<p>Then I started to skim through places and
what finished me is calling those who actively nag about the shape of ifs used during code review as &ldquo;philosophers&rdquo;.
Why not to call them &ldquo;philosopher-kings&rdquo; right-away then?</p>
<p>Probably editor or some other &ldquo;reviewer&rdquo; must have nagged the author into doing all this.
Otherwise I would think that writing libraries should be considered harmful.</p>
