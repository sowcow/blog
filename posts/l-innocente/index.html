It is not a movie for rewatching for me.
I feel that that &ldquo;dark freedom&rdquo; mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive.

<p>TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders. A female makes a poor choice of the husband. Then gets his attention by having somebody on a side with unintended consequences. Then basically tells him to solve the problem while not understandnig it.</p>
<p>On one hand at some times the story and scenes resemble a soap opera.
So I found myself thinking that this exploration of Visconti made me do impossible - watch something with that angle in it.
But I watched mostly into how he arranges scenes.
(Not that I know much and have reference points at this point but overall I want to get maximum from the director)</p>
<p>Obviously aristocratic views.
Main music theme resembled Death in Venice in its confusedness.</p>
<p>The last movie by Visconti.
Also last one of him that I have seen the first time.</p>
<p>I want to give another round to The Leopard for reasons I do not understand.</p>
<p>Interestingly that when the guy solved another problem I felt release of some tension.
And a minute before that when the guy took a sharp looking jewelry from a head of his mistress I expected some danger.
Also at different points in the movie the guy was fighting with rapiers.
I assume that jewelry taking scene was supposed to feel dangerous!</p>
<p>Anyway I think danger is not kind of tension I prefer to experience in movies.
My self image says that I prefer light comedic release of also light tension.
But I can watch messy stuff if it has trash aspect - so it is not serious.
Also if there is a food for brains but in this movie the food has some serious chemical smell around it if you ask me.</p>
