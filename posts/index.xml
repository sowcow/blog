      <title>Till You Make It</title>

      <description>Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself. I thought that there has to be a reason for that. And indeed I found couple of them.
Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it&amp;rsquo;s source.
And then I thought about artificial sources.
Given say body positivity. When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves. This is ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Random Dentist Experience</title>

      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>

      <description>I really like reading History of Gallic Wars by Caesar.
There are interesting small details everywhere: details about politics, contracts, warfare, decision making.
The narrative itself is also quite fascinating to me.</description>

      <description>Another interesting insight from reading GTD is that there is a level of positive feelings you get from envisioning future results of your projects.
The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process. So the need to have &amp;ldquo;artificial sweeteners&amp;rdquo; goes down.
I think that excitement is the only reasonable expectation from your projects with this system.</description>

      <title>Getting Things Done</title>

      <description>There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.
 The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.  So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons. And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.
BTW I use org-mode to implement it. I am happy with the proccess.</description>

      <title>Real Abstractions</title>

      <description>Abstractions are real.
Brains work with them.
And you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore what goes into your brain.
Things you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore are real for you.
Reality of production is reflected in the product.
Well. That was a tricky way to state that in the ideal world code quality is measured by the quality of abstractions.</description>

      <description>There is the idea of being in the moment.
And there is also an idea of future self.
I think the real idea is to have both things reconciled into single, repeatable understanding.
Otherwise you act not in your own interest.</description>

      <title>Intellectual Toys</title>
      <link>https://sowcow.github.io/blog/posts/intellectual-toys/</link>

      <description>I want to write an argument that there is a kind of people who like intellectual toys in certain area.
Earlier they found theology to be interesting.
Later such people were playing with philosophies, ideologies like communism.
And now such people may be writing code.
So people who are into religious fundamentalism or communism should definetly try coding.
Unfortunately in code you cannot use verbal tricks or force. But the good part is that you are not subject to the constrains of the real world either.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Code</title>

      <description>I was looking at what I am doing wrong with my personal projects recently. And I think that part of the problem is this unconstrained approach.
So there is the propensity in people to be blindly optimistic about something. I found mine to be interfering with the code.
So I gotta learn some good constraints.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try some very directed and formal approach with explicit principles and compromises.</description>

      <title>Constrained Games</title>

      <description>Constraints in mobile games are everywhere. And they are so explicit.
I have no idea why people voluntary accept constraints. Maybe because there are &amp;ldquo;opportunities&amp;rdquo; available around the constraints.
Somebody has to make a game where number of opportunities is decreacing all the time. To observe the influence.</description>

      <title>Complexity Order</title>

      <description>The title may be ambiguous/misleading. And chances are the idea is old.
The idea is that you add complexity in the right order. I think this is the real idea behind KISS/YAGNI/etc..
For me the right/wrong here is intuitive. I need to return to it later.</description>

      <description>Background facts I have not practiced consistently. And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.
Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know meditation again. With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly. Also the alternative &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; is available. This is something new for me.</description>

      <description>I hope this blog is not going to be corrupted by politics too much.
One can sign a propaganda plakat. But one cannot sign a word. How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.
Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones. Words like &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ABC rights&amp;rdquo;, etc&amp;hellip; Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.</description>

      <description>The plan is to post some stuff I do. Like what I read for example. With some analysis maybe.
Only the good stuff.
In the end I should get more invested in the stuff.</description>
