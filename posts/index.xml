      <description>Background facts I have not practiced consistently. And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.
Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know meditation again. With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly. Also the alternative &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; is available. This is something new for me.</description>

      <description>I hope this blog is not going to be corrupted by politics too much.
One can sign a propaganda plakat. But one cannot sign a word. How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.
Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones. Words like &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ABC rights&amp;rdquo;, etc&amp;hellip; Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.</description>

      <description>The plan is to post some stuff I do. Like what I read for example. With some analysis maybe.
Only the good stuff.
In the end I should get more invested in the stuff.</description>
