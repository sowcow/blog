      <description>Heat On one hand the topic is heated so it is not advised for polite discussion. On the other hand there is some insight to extract.
Naming The scope of what is called &amp;ldquo;special operation&amp;rdquo; actually is nuclear. One can say that it is an invasion or war - expecting the worse. But also this can be something addittional to that - one move in some combination on the geopolicial landscape.</description>

      <description>Some Context Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems. Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out. So the opportunity to do that was realized.
Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon. And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop. So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.
City Lights Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.
Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.
But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that people would do worse and voluntary. That error of underestimating idiocy and comedy of real-life I should stop committing.
Anyway some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.
At least now I know that the game is not as demanding physically and oxygen-wise as I thought. But also everybody got entertained by this new equipment.</description>

      <description>This is not the first time I see this. But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used. It makes things more understandable and more like communication.
So I liked how director emphasises certain places. That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience. Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.
Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed.</description>

      <description>In Russian to cheer for the team can be directly translated into english as &amp;ldquo;to be ill for&amp;rdquo;.
I found it amusing when a reporter from Olympics in China said that &amp;ldquo;We are still being ill here&amp;rdquo;.
Also between that it is very patriotic to show some soviet technological developments/acheivements that were not pursued after the fall. So that people feel the dark sorrow for the glorious past and resentment toward ideological enemies.</description>

      <description>Digital world incentives makes for some odd-looking entropy.
Things at one point can be quite good. But then they don&amp;rsquo;t grow in understandeable sense - they may still have some reason to be attractive on one side on another side they just devolve and get stupider and uglier for no meaningful reason.
So you get this mixed bag. And there is something like loss-aversion or switching cost. Which I think is a costly intuition in these matters.</description>

      <description>I have heard that there was this show ran by Oprah. At that point I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the language. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t watch shows.
But still somehow indirectly through environment I got this impression that if you got a really hard question and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do then there is always Oprah to answer it. And the final answer to any question is: Oprah knows.
Today the first time in my life google pointed me to oprah.</description>

      <description>There are limited choices in my habitat. One example is that you can&amp;rsquo;t get good slippers. Like there is a fashion that dictates slippers to be always so small that the foot gets molded by them.
So at one point I found a pair with eastern design with noses up. I bought the biggest pair and with the pattern that can be considired stylyzed dollar signs on all sides if one wants to see it that way.</description>

      <description>Spoilers Land
The movie has multiple parts. I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in. And then to write more gave another look. And then I could not resisit another look&amp;hellip;
The setting is in the Alps. Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls. Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points&amp;hellip; Red color is favored there.</description>

      <description>There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way. I&amp;rsquo;m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.
The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.
 First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued; Second when he revives the diva; Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking; And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;  I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it&amp;rsquo;s place.</description>

      <description>I watched alot of stuff in 2021 that I&amp;rsquo;d like to write something about just to see how it goes. But there should be a starting point somewhere and the most recent movie is the subject of the post.
The movie is short so the post should follow the shape of the movie.
What I have seen is lots of patches with with some light humour everywhere in between. Patches are different and that may be confusing because it looks like there are serious topics interwoven.</description>

      <description>Back in a day I liked heroes of might and magic game. Overall it was not right to get me addicted but I really liked some parts.
One thing I found odd is that there are like ten types of dragons. Most of them I considered to be nonsensical - created just to fill some gaps in ideas.
One particular kind of dragons I liked irrationally is the Skeleton Dragon that can be upgraded to the Ghost Dragon.</description>

      <description>This post is like a smell of a level-up of a kind.
For some time I wanted to write a post about where this simple writing experiment got me. Surely interest in arts is involved too.
What got me to that idea is that everytime I go for a walk I see something new. Something worth recording or trying to analyse in a post. So there is plenty of simple-looking experiences but in limited time non obvious how to approach in a contained way.</description>

      <description>I decided to finally check on how smarter animals organize their groups. I decided to start with ravens because they came to the mind recently. This one was the first that came-out of the google although I know there is a recommendation on this kind of books that I need to dig-out.
I&amp;rsquo;m in the beginning and there is that feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be told anything organizational. Because the book goes into details on peculiar stuff that is cool from another point of view.</description>

      <description>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
 The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.</description>

      <description>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with.</description>

      <description>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.
Visually and overall I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new.</description>

      <description>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I&amp;rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can&amp;rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I&amp;rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.</description>

      <description>I have just returned from a walk. On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing. I tried to look at it and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow. So these &amp;ldquo;golden-hats&amp;rdquo; the church has make it possible to see it even further. I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.
There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays.</description>

      <description>You see the good quality there. There is class I believe too.
One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I&amp;rsquo;m used to capture but it is definetly visible.
The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.
Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish. At some points you may think: &amp;ldquo;What kind of dialogs are these?</description>

      <description>I watched some of it. I&amp;rsquo;ll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.
Other The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.
The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure. (I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn&amp;rsquo;t really live through that time.</description>

      <description>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that &amp;ldquo;surrounding&amp;rdquo; Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.</description>

      <description>Found-out that scribd has some good stuff that I wanted to check like this title. So I got over first three chapters in audio format. Looking at how it goes I would switch to the short version in this case.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t eat while listening to it because the author does alot of stuff in the beginning for sure. I think consciously but who knows; Even though narrated by the author the experience is very copy-paste/so-conventional from the execution point of view.</description>

      <description>First. Visually interesting without question. I also liked characters there. Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.
The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze. And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.
There is this word &amp;ldquo;soviet intelligent-sy&amp;rdquo;. It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time.</description>

      <description>Usually I&amp;rsquo;m not big into reading and reading newspapers. But a couple days ago I stumbled upon one article. Actually the article won the competition among other headers first. Then I just got to like the rich tools used in the content. Basically the article got me captured starting from the header.
And this is unusual for me. So I checked the author. She has only one another article there. But there are many other books and articles in foreign media too.</description>

      <description>So I got a random dream some days ago. In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn&amp;rsquo;t do for a number of years). Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.
I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner.</description>

      <description>I started this course some time ago and then got distracted. I got to reorganize my goals recently so I returned to it and it goes well this time.
One thing I noticed this time is that the quality of the production is actually good and helps the viewer. For example at any point one can move the attention to say creative stage background that is a mess too. It looks like somebodies experiments but it offers a light puzzle-like content to check at any point.</description>

Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator (Aug 25) It is the most recomended one on the subject. It is cool in its own way. But not in the way it is recommended by many.</description>

      <description>Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.
Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art. And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward. This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.
I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely. Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does.</description>

      <description>Post-soviet land has it&amp;rsquo;s own charm and peculiarities. One of these is propaganda.
Today I noticed something. Imagine hearing talk about war atrocities of your ideological opponents in a kind of whispering way from the TV.
This kind of content, even if dirty, still can make one proud of local acheivements in propaganda.
Western propaganda that I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to is not of a good taste for me. I cannot enjoy the cheap way it is delivered.</description>

      <description>Initially I thought that &amp;ldquo;extremely funny nonsense&amp;rdquo; describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.
But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive. So that it may require some tools to weave that. Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that.</description>

      <description>There is an interesting for me kind of posts where I explore near some more practical idea and that idea by itself may be only lightly implied or touched. Or I go on some random tangent and the case that got me writing is completely ignored.
In this one the tangent is that contextless things imply reactive behavior.
So I think that goal of advertisments for exapmle is to distract a person into situation for which the subject does not have the context ready.</description>

      <description>So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.
Abstract:
 time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can&amp;rsquo;t put your attention on it the space around us is what is actually persistent and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it active attention is what I mean in the post.</description>

      <description>I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow but it always finds a way to astonish you.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective. I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I&amp;rsquo;m so used to like. But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation. It is just that odd and in a way immutable. This way of looking at it seems new to me.</description>

      <description>I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.
Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.
I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.
Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
 NOTE: some spoilers ahead
 The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is.</description>

      <description>First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.
The beginning predictably left me not excited. The movie provides some words to describe it: &amp;ldquo;too modern&amp;rdquo;. And the word &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; came to my mind too. No idea why. I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.
At the end of the first third you get to see some development and get intrigued by it.</description>

      <description>Threre is this blender-question related to apple hiring.
Initially I thought: &amp;ldquo;what a stupid question&amp;rdquo;:
 amygdala stuff at the core incomplete and nonsensical context  So in abstract this question primes for stupidity. Although in the context of hiring interview I assume that primes for some creativity.
I have no idea if it is useful in the hiring context. But in abstract it is like an ugly but educational toy.</description>

      <description>There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days. It can be summarized this way: I didn&amp;rsquo;t beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter. And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that. But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.
Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view.</description>

      <description>I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).
It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.
Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.
I think that it works this way:</description>

      <description>Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well. Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing. And that I&amp;rsquo;m not the right audience for the theme overall. And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.
During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work. At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet.</description>

      <description>Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say&amp;hellip; I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas&amp;hellip;
I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.
Pros:
 Some nice shots are present Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there  Cons:
 pace is not for me messy so called &amp;ldquo;psychological&amp;rdquo; stuff about characters being unhappy and all that does not attract me ugly sounds play from time to time  Notables:</description>

      <description>I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.
They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
 clean background and possibly interesting lightening very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!) modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness) made in multiple shots narrative is delivered from this device that runs text narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material&amp;hellip;  The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.</description>

      <description>So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.
Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between. I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place.</description>

      <description>Approach So I&amp;rsquo;m excited about my third approach of the market. It is different from the previous ones.
The latest thinking is that margin is by default is not going to be used at all.
I have an interesting idea to start with &amp;ldquo;paper-trading&amp;rdquo; and then introduce cash gradually (with randomness actually to even not know the size of the position first to be more chill). Actual paper-trading should address the greed to jump into the last wagon and be more chill.</description>

      <description>Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.
Anyway visually I&amp;rsquo;m just too easy to impress so I liked many &amp;ldquo;shots&amp;rdquo;.
There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.
I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.
I bet there are good scientific theories but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:
 social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not  </description>

      <description>I definetly liked some scenes most notably driving throug fog.
There are some obvious things directors do:
 in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds (so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works) in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?</description>

These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor. But the skin gets even more expensive!
And with all the abundant money supply these days also. I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.

      <description>So yesterday was the flight and I wanted to put some obvious observations here and mostly comparsion with Virgin Galactic flight about a week ago.
I only go from comparsion point of view because it makes it easy.
So first striking difference was that VG used Mr. Colbert to host the show while BO had some way more serious most of the time.
Altohugh I must say that one comic thing BO show host was doing repeatedly is reminding about Karman line in different ways and one time she even instantly followed Karman line remark with big windows remark.</description>

      <description>One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was. First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background. Now I decided to try another one and you guess what. It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits. Then it contrasts it by some piano notes.</description>

      <description>The one by Zeffirelli. Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.
The first impression is what is called &amp;ldquo;Tube sound&amp;rdquo; in Russia at least. So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case. After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive it is quality of the movie too. It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy.</description>

      <description>It looks like get levelups and paid-for lessons from the marked every day.
Gotta write my thoughts somewhere so this place seems fit for that.
So I possibly see what is the difference between a complete &amp;ldquo;hamster&amp;rdquo; and a bit more strategic let&amp;rsquo;s say &amp;ldquo;hunter&amp;rdquo;.
Hamster has a very short information window and that makes the thinking impossible so he acts with lizard brain (so looses money). Also random tips or even other hamsters &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; and stuff that is not understandeable as price movement in the moment itself is also not a food for advanced brain so it shrinks its involvement I think and causes what it casuses.</description>

It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images. As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision. And it was compelling in some way to me.
I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too.</description>

      <description>Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant I can&amp;rsquo;t be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it&amp;rsquo;s pillars.
One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes. Modern way is to call it oppression. Everybody loves new words.
And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his &amp;ldquo;followers&amp;rdquo; who established that soviet union rule here should be liars and anything they say must be deception.</description>

      <description>Watched the movie. It seems more balanced than Interstellar. It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that). But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.
It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.
It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological. Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I&amp;rsquo;ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed.</description>

      <description>Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli. Not in one session on one hand. But on the other hand the second session was something different and very fresh for me.
Alot of times the picture just looks well. I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.
In school I didn&amp;rsquo;t read stuff. They forced stuff on us and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that.</description>

      <description>Got some cool ride in all directions from SPCE recently.
So I got alot of not-easily to reconcile experience that is not cheep also.
Anyway gotta write some my levelup thoughts so I remember them better.
 Unexpected stuff happens at any time and in any combinations. Gotta learn and be ready (chosen strategy) from the decision point. it is about strategy choice from options and then appropriate execution plan and execution and not about any price moves at all margin is a wild thingy, I&amp;rsquo;m not used to that now but gotta improve :) also one should be able to ignore price movements and forget about the account money (and potentially have more cash to compensate for it if negative news coming-out) intraday requires back-testing and knowledge of probabilities and stop-loss distance is a crucial part of it and actualy automated system I think (so is not really an option outside of some obvious &amp;ldquo;rockets&amp;rdquo;) other than intraday holding without margin is easy thing to do but take profits should be automated entry also should be distributed over a period where you want to flatten price movements and completely ignore them manipulations or unexpected stuff happens so one cannot be unprepared to anything if you watch at the price charts forget ease and comfort irregardless of where the price goes it is like a work - you need to be on time on crucial points and be ready (also timeboxed decision making, not random urgent stupid actions) in a way being serious and methodical works I beleive but also being open-minded for unexpected stuff is a necessary part of it!</description>

      <description>So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.
First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks. And I holded them. Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.
Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold. And missed some good actual run from that point.</description>

      <description>Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock. Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.
Some theories on what happened:
 Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash stock offering profit fixation on the main session  A lot of hamsters (including me) who missed the tesla hype expected the SPCE to became the new one. And I beleive that accounted for bigger than normal swings.</description>

      <description>The movie is like a story with different aspects to it. It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations. But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.
One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s table is. Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene.</description>

      <description>Here I should have impressions on the works of the director.
Romeo and Juliet I&amp;rsquo;m not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.
I liked the main theme. And some scenes for sure. And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.
One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected).</description>

      <description>I beleive I found explanation to what caused all the 20th century chaos and ugliness.
One could say it is human nature or nature of existance overall. But I want to get more specific answer.
But even to say that the guy Marx started all the hastle without knowing it is not specific enough. Because one can still zoom-in to find for more fine answer.
I was thinking about it and I think I finally got it.</description>

So these days I pay attention to form and that affect decisions.</description>

So actually even if I plan to go and do something. It is useful to have a plan B of how not to do that&amp;hellip;
Sounds odd but this is the case for automoton like me!</description>

      <description>Abstract Open libraries are so cool. They motivate by themselves. Borrowing and kind-of a limit of time makes the book even more attractive.
Here I just do own notes to review them after I finished reading. It is not something pretending to have been carefully extracted and distilled. Sometimes in the process I just do not record stuff, sometimes I record alot more.

      <description>My first movie of the director. I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall. I put there thoughts I got from it.
Scenes: In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist. The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start.</description>

      <description>It is strange that in the top politics (the US) we see every next round hitting newst lows compared to previous rounds.
Normally in the nature even insects and bacteria evolve. Why politicians it seems devolve?
I mean if the &amp;ldquo;IQ-descent&amp;rdquo; theory is right then it should make sense. Then it would be cool to see nature restoring evolution back. So that all the good political-stuff is not in the past.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t use names here because they does not matter. It is not a movie for rewatching for me. I feel that that &amp;ldquo;dark freedom&amp;rdquo; mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive. One the other hand it still takes it&amp;rsquo;s own place. With it&amp;rsquo;s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment. But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view. No idea why.
TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders.</description>

      <description>Beautiful aesthetics. Not to say about views of Venice and Italy. Both strong feelings and something different also.
My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :). The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different. So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!
There is a class difference that I see in different movies. Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.</description>

      <description>I heave read about some strange practices that some marginal groups or individuals praticed. So there was something like trying to force oneself into seeing non-existing things and not seeing things that are there.
It looks like these days there are adpets at every corner. And they have acheived highest levels of trance.
I assume levels of subversion with the advent of mass media are so high. That they don&amp;rsquo;t need to pratice anything to get that state.</description>

      <description>I found that I pay attention to the good quality views around me more. Summer of course.
There is another thing possibly due to how my memory works. It looks like it is the first time I pay this much attention.
And I think this is the case in many cases.
Like horison line with trees looks so much better. Even colors of leafs and sky there.
Overall blossoming of course is so plentiful.</description>

      <description>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well. But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching. Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.
 Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer I&amp;rsquo;m totally amateur in all this stuff so this &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.
Music Music was one of liberal arts education subjects. I strongly feel that it is for a reason.
On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it offers certain hope and positive expectations.
On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.</description>

      <description>Watched Obsession by Visconti. I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.
Spoilers ahead of course. I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.
Lightning I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity. You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).
There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don&amp;rsquo;t remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues.</description>

      <description>Context I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything. And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.
Thoughts It was always visually interesting experience for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect black and white movies being such rich medium. Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.
I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.
The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo; that I like for some reason. I assume they can be &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;m not that sure in my memory to be certain.
If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point.</description>

      <description>April fools day is approaching. But looking at trends this is going to be a century of fools anyway.
I thought about abstract notions like freedom, equality, security, even dignity that Visconti recently have impressed on me.
I beleive these notions if allowed to be regarded as meaningful without having them clearly defined create a bad habbit of not using reason at all and leave back doors to humans brains for more cunning ones to use.</description>

So I got a shot of the vaccine Sputnik-V (I hope :).
Anyway I got a fever now as normal reaction. Basically I got a modified chimpanzee virus inside which is fun aspect of it.
Another interesting aspect is that I got it at the same day (I hope :) as the first citizen of the country.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.
I decided to have some stuff written. Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself. Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.
Also I can&amp;rsquo;t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.</description>

      <description>Fishes moving in a flock.
Since humans are more advanced than fish I assume they are even better at such movements and maneuvers. They have more options to do that and have cool creative explanations for doing that.
My favorite flock in political waters are certain kind of individualists. Those who are all very unique of course but also equal for sure.
I bet those owning social networks hide alot of information about such flocks.</description>

Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.
I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.

And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being.

Concerning Nolan. I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes. Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.</description>

      <description>It is in a way like in that movie: Inception. There are forgotten situations that has power over you. And there are symbols that you get to have around instead. At some point you decode the symbols back.

Reading  I have finished small german language book that was laying around for too long I have started learning a new programming language so I have read a couple of books on it There are more books on it waiting for their turn  Code  I started playing with a physical engine I started playing with NNs Then I lost interest but I&amp;rsquo;m going to return this weekend because there are other motivating factors  What didn&amp;rsquo;t Work Sun Tzu realy wasn&amp;rsquo;t right for me.</description>

      <description>Reading Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy. I wanted to write about it but it is not the case that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics. Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.
Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs. Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that. Even though author mildly argues for that also.</description>

      <description>I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about anything interesting.
Although I have started listening to Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy. I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it methodically and I&amp;rsquo;m not really in control of personal time now.
So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.
First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like and then I move to something else.</description>

      <description>I think this post spoils the movie in a way. It can provide different experience to somebody else.
 I have watched the movie. Although art is not somethig I know much, I have a couple of thoughts about art after the movie.
It is about making a name So the stuff modernists produce by just exploring the medium before others done it is worth as much as random numbers.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Hear me today discoursing in the house of Quadratus.
&amp;ndash; Why should I hear you? Do you wish to show me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together man. And what good will it do you?
 So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus. The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.
The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is also entertaining and with a lot of humour.</description>

      <description>I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all. But this time I decided to look into his content.
First I got into some debate youtube videos of him. And it was ok.
So I decided to look into his audiobook.
I found the first part quite informative for me:
 I really like biological facts about how things work Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others)  But then after 50% the real fun starts.</description>

      <description>While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it. The stuff even felt attractive in theory.
So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.
What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points. It didn&amp;rsquo;t look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan.</description>

      <description>I have a couple of things that I noticed while reading &amp;ldquo;Discrimination and Disparities&amp;rdquo; by T. Sowell.
Obviously the authour is a very logical and factual no BS guy.
The book is full of tricks politicans use and facts they tend to hide.
I noticed this disambiguation of the term &amp;ldquo;discrimination&amp;rdquo; by the author:
 evidence based discrimination (1A): based on knowledge of traits and behavior of a given individual evidence based discrimination (1B): based on statistics on group behavior, traits arbitrary discrimination (2): arbitrary/irrational  This is how I understood this.</description>

      <description>I decided to write short summary and some ideas after reading &amp;ldquo;Out of the Tar Pit&amp;rdquo;.
Summary It looks like a theoretical high level paper about comlexity in large codebases.
The main point can be statend in the form: eliminate stuff/separate certain parts of the system to reduce power/ability to introduce accedintal complexity.
What is being separated: essential state, essential logic, control.
Also proposed ways to implement these parts:
 state - relaitons logic - pure functions  My Thoughts I am pretty convinced that relations are the way to go for the essential state.</description>

      <description>The word &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; is the most prominent example of language abuse for politics sake.
 It is short and not some yet another pseudo scientific &amp;ldquo;-ism&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;-fobia&amp;rdquo;. So it looks more natural on the outset; It has &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; in it :) You can create new &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; every day by adding different perfixes; You can use it to extract something from somebody; Since it is vague term it can have broad uses especially when it comes to general public; It also informs users on how to act/behave when demanding something from others: righteously;  </description>

      <description>So I decided to put some thoughts about my coding here. There are three of them.
Copy-pasting This is one of my time wasters. I have this expectation that copy-pasted block should just work. But then there are little details that I miss that require a debugging session later.
Copy pasting by itself is not that evil. It can be avoided by additional abstractions. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit to any random abstraction either.</description>

      <description>Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself. I thought that there has to be a reason for that. And indeed I found couple of them.
Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it&amp;rsquo;s source.
And then I thought about artificial sources.
Given say body positivity. When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves. This is ambiguous.</description>

      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>

      <description>I really like reading History of Gallic Wars by Caesar.
There are interesting small details everywhere: details about politics, contracts, warfare, decision making.
The narrative itself is also quite fascinating to me.
Also national differences that are depicted in the book are quite entertaining.</description>

      <description>Another interesting insight from reading GTD is that there is a level of positive feelings you get from envisioning future results of your projects.
The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process. So the need to have &amp;ldquo;artificial sweeteners&amp;rdquo; goes down.
I think that excitement is the only reasonable expectation from your projects with this system.</description>

      <description>There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.
 The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.  So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons. And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.
BTW I use org-mode to implement it. I am happy with the proccess.</description>

      <description>Abstractions are real.
Brains work with them.
And you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore what goes into your brain.
Things you can&amp;rsquo;t ignore are real for you.
Reality of production is reflected in the product.
 Well. That was a tricky way to state that in the ideal world code quality is measured by the quality of abstractions.</description>

      <description>There is the idea of being in the moment.
And there is also an idea of future self.
I think the real idea is to have both things reconciled into single, repeatable understanding.
Otherwise you act not in your own interest.</description>

      <description>I want to write an argument that there is a kind of people who like intellectual toys in certain area.
Earlier they found theology to be interesting.
Later such people were playing with philosophies, ideologies like communism.
And now such people may be writing code.
So people who are into religious fundamentalism or communism should definetly try coding.
Unfortunately in code you cannot use verbal tricks or force. But the good part is that you are not subject to the constrains of the real world either.</description>

      <description>I was looking at what I am doing wrong with my personal projects recently. And I think that part of the problem is this unconstrained approach.
So there is the propensity in people to be blindly optimistic about something. I found mine to be interfering with the code.
So I gotta learn some good constraints.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try some very directed and formal approach with explicit principles and compromises.</description>

      <description>Constraints in mobile games are everywhere. And they are so explicit.
I have no idea why people voluntary accept constraints. Maybe because there are &amp;ldquo;opportunities&amp;rdquo; available around the constraints.
Somebody has to make a game where number of opportunities is decreacing all the time. To observe the influence.</description>

      <description>The title may be ambiguous/misleading. And chances are the idea is old.
The idea is that you add complexity in the right order. I think this is the real idea behind KISS/YAGNI/etc..
For me the right/wrong here is intuitive. I need to return to it later.</description>

One can sign a propaganda plakat. But one cannot sign a word. How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.
Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones. Words like &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ABC rights&amp;rdquo;, etc&amp;hellip; Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.</description>
