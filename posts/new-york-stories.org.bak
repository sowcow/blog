The first segment of New York Stories is by Scorcese.
I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still.

Scorcese delivered on expectations about the main character.
Confident, messed-up, even with criminalish theme in own way.
Heights and lows, passions, chains and cages.

He is an established artist who runs some messed-up relational meatgrinder in his studo.
And he produces pieces for consumption by upper class New York who lives in their business meatgrinder.

His assistant is not having light cruise.
But he is always one step ahead of her.
And he does his part of life lessons as promised.

What caught my attention early is that Scorcese gives first person look of professional deformations of a painter.
Notably scene near the elevator also tunnel-vision-like/flash-back incidents.
But there is also other enjoyable use of visual language by the director.

One hint was about the artist being a director himself.
Also one can play with ideas of pure and clear canvas and the rich dirt of paint.
Or with the energy, music and this navigation of bordering the known and waters of normal.
The spirit of artist and explorer.

Music plays a big role - it definetly has meaningful cultural references that I didn't look into at this point.
Also the main painting itself I interpreted differently both times I watched the piece.
So there is even make-you-own-interpretation component because of the painting.
This offers rewatcheability but I assume the cost of rewatcheability is that not all questions will be resolved and it should be expected and tolerated to some extent.

Other segments are nice too.
They contrast well the first one.
It is that the first piece has so many uncertainty unresolved that one can feel
like other pieces sound too quiet and they are too plain.
But that is the point.
