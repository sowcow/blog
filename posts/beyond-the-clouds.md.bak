I wanted to visit this one for the second time, with some rewinds but still.

There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not.
It is very satisfying to see the director's play and then he confirms it too.

That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested.
It is a funny scene on the first look.

Another look is to compare the picutre to one of the latest girl talking scenes.
That brings starting monologue of the director.
Then ultimately compare it to the final shot through the window.

Final movie by the director.
Things expressed are bound to be misunderstood by many.
Unexpressed things are bound to disappear.

- Visual, some shapes just do not take verbal forms
- Director-ness, Peeping Tom degree of it
- Your Blue Room - chroma key room
