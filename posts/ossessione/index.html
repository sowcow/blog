  <div class="post-content"><p>Watched Obsession by Visconti.
I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.</p>
<p>Spoilers ahead of course.
I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.</p>
<h3 id="lightning">Lightning</h3>
<p>I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity.
You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).</p>
<p>There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don&rsquo;t remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues.</p>
<h3 id="mind-dump">Mind-dump</h3>
<p>I thought that the beginning is a bit &ldquo;raw&rdquo; and is not the aesthetics I expected from Visconti.
I even caught myself thinking that Visconti wanted to make something for working class.</p>
<p>At the end of the part (before the murder) things get more cheerful.</p>
<p>And I think there is not only age difference but class difference that is being highlighted.</p>
<p>(I forgot names since I write this way later&hellip;)
(Also I want to sleep and this makes this to be very odd piece of text)</p>
<p>Males are more than blind in the beginning and alot of clues about females intentions are obvious.
So director is being direct with the viewer about what is going on.</p>
<p>Basically there are two males.
One is very down to earth owner of own place and business.
Another is traveling and not being bound by anythnig.</p>
<p>There are two notable females in the movie.
The main one is like a spider who uses both males to the fullest.
Another is a very interesting occurance is probably the option
more fitting to the &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; but he already covered by net at that point.
Not only by the &ldquo;spider&rdquo; but also by cops.</p>
<p>Closer to the end there is an interesting twist where
a future child is supposed to redeem the murderer-couple.
But the fate crushes them in a similar way they murdered the &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also interestingly fate is being &ldquo;gracious&rdquo; by giving everybody except
the &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; some euphoria and good time before their end.</p>
<p>One odd small scene is where &ldquo;traveller&quot;s friend is talking to cops.
I didn&rsquo;t understand what that is about.</p>
<p>(I hope this reads not as bad as I think)</p>
