<h1 id="vortex-ring-state">Vortex Ring State</h1>
<p><img src="/blog/VRS.png" alt="heli and airflow in a vortex ring state"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>VRS happens when you are trapped in a column of disrupted air created by your own rotor blades, and this (unfortunately) often occurs at the most critical part of flight: on LANDING.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A fully developed vortex ring state is characterized by an unstable condition in which the helicopter experiences
uncommanded pitch and roll oscillations, has little or no collective authority, and achieves a descent rate that may approach
6,000 feet per minute (fpm) if allowed to develop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that &ldquo;new air&rdquo; input allows the system to move/climb, but inside the vortex ring state it&rsquo;s only the &ldquo;old air&rdquo; circulation.
The point is that if the condition is allowed to develop then powering out of it would not work in aircraft of interest, because it only rotates the pattern of air faster and gives it more energy for sinking down, but does not introduce new input, so fall continues.</p>
<p>So there seem to be two ways out - by gaining forward momentum while still losing height/energy so it may not be applicable, or by more economical side maneuver using tail rotor that is unaffected/orthogonal to the vortex ring.</p>
<p>Normally one corrects it early because it&rsquo;s noticable in different ways including low-g feel of accelerating down.</p>
<h1 id="autorotation">Autorotation</h1>
<p><img src="/blog/Autorotation.jpg" alt="airflow in autorotation"></p>
<p>Unrelated to VRS but also significant is autorotation.
This one can be used when the engine loses power and the rotor is kept rotating only by the airflow coming from a controlled descent/fall, to reduce the rate of falling.
It requires good control over the parameters by the pilot and even using stopping power of flares at certain points.</p>
<h1 id="in-case-you-are-crazy">In case you are crazy</h1>
<p>Hardware is quite a cost sink when it comes to simulators.
Otherwise, the helicopter is free to play for two weeks;
the Germany map is not free to play at the time;
Chuck&rsquo;s Guides: Huey Guide is the go-to guide.</p>
