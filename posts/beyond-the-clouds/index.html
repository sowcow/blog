<p>There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not.
It is very satisfying to see the director&rsquo;s play and then he confirms it too.</p>
<p>That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested.
It is a funny scene on the first look.</p>
<p>Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes.
That brings starting monologue of the director.
Then ultimately compare it to the final shot through the window.</p>
<p>Final movie by the director.
Things expressed are bound to be misunderstood by many.
Unexpressed things are bound to disappear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual, some shapes just do not take verbal forms</li>
<li>Director-ness, Peeping Tom degree of it</li>
<li>Your Blue Room - chroma key room</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>The nod can also bring bring Claudia Cardinale from Conversation Piece.
Or Asian theme from La Dolce Vita.
But this must cross a line into some inside language.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S.S.</p>
<p>As I understand it Wim Wenders shot framing of the picture and intermissions between the four stories.
This framing talks own story and there was some disagreement between directors.
Given the capital of this picture I&rsquo;m going to have another try of some other work by Wenders.</p>
<p>Wenders was &ldquo;loud&rdquo; and explicit in own way in the picture.
But scenes like that helicopters scene they have progression/potential in them
and that creates sense of depth and quality of detalization.
On my previous incomplete attempt I got some shallow impression of the director and maybe there was just alien style with similar loudness in that movie.
But I think the degree of explicitness is necessary to invite into more ambiguous play.</p>
<p>So one point is that alien loud style does not necessitate shallowness.
Another point probably is that different people would see patterns/depth in different domains and so directors produce in domains where they have ideas and thus different pictures may cover different areas and have different match.</p>
<p>Also this big filter of aesthetical preferences is a mechanism of it&rsquo;s own.
So I still haven&rsquo;t decided whether to suspend aesthetical judgment and reconsider the alien movie or to select another one.</p>
