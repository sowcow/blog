I started this course some time ago and then got distracted.
I got to reorganize my goals recently so I returned to it and it goes well this time.

One thing I noticed this time is that the quality of the production is actually good and helps the viewer.
For example at any point one can move the attention to say creative stage background that is a mess too.
It looks like somebodies experiments but it offers a light puzzle-like content to check at any point.
Also the host does his job very well.

Anyway the idea of german quality is one thing that contributed to me starting learning it so I choose content appropriately.
Also another thing that I enjoyed early was Deutsche Welle set of audio courses.
