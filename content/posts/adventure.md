Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.

Anyway visually I'm just too easy to impress so I liked many "shots".

There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.

I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode...
