Initially I thought that "extremely funny nonsense" describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.

But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive.
So that it may require some tools to weave that.
Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that.

Another observation is that at least once directors used repetition and then pause to highlight something.
And there was less obvious but very funny aspect of the scene to highlight.
Also I remember that Zeffirelli once used a bit outstanding event that did not advance the story. And I thought that he used that just to highlight one symbol used there.

So this movie confirmed me thinking in terms of markers to highlight and request addittional attention to something.
