I've watched both Ikiru and The Blob on the same day.
And then finished it with Pee-wee's Big Adventure.
Now I'll need to live with this, so I need to rethink this blog's philosophy.

Maybe it will be ratings blog.
So I'll rate them.

1. Ikiru goes first because rabbits can jump and they'd smash the competitors
2. The Blob takes the second place because it destroys dinosaurs
3. Pee-Wee is the last because he was riding in the wrong direction
