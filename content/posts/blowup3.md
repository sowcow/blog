I believe it is my third watch.
Four years after my first watch, I was able to appreciate it, I think, if not fully, then substantially.
I'm siding with the director and not spoiling the interpretation.

Sometimes you don't spoil because it is like telling a secret.
Sometimes it needs to be earned, so itâ€™s not pearls before swine.
At times you don't spoil because it is an embarrassment, and the kind that also needs to be earned.
