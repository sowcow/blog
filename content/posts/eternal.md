Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.

Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art.
And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward.
This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.

I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely.
Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does.

So it is a pursuit or exploration of eternal.
Is there a strongest bind?

While writing it I remembered what other stuff is there.
Like art being attached to status on one hand.
And on the other hand for example they put a statue of shit in Moscow recently.
And there are those who destroy arts.
So I guess humans foolishness competes to be eternal too.
