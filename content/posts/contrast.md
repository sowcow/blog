There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days.
It can be summarized this way: I didn't beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter.
And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that.
But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.

Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view.
And in these occasions preceding view was very different and in a way contrasted to the next.

So I start to see some of the effect in practice.
And it requires active attention and is not given.

It seems seing some aspects of beauty kind of sets a standard that you use.
And then you try see other standards at less conspicuous levels.
And this is one of paths to explore the medium.
