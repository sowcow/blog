The whole experience with the movie for me was Snakes and Ladders.
And it took me some time to finish the maze.

So I got the "creative" answers, but analytical breadth is still there.
And digging it analytically is irrational and risks overstretching it at this point (again).

Now in order to conclude such a complex "relationship" with a movie it asks to be terminated in some expressive or creative action also.
So I follow the example and express it by ordering visuals.
