I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.

It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images.
As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision.
And it was compelling in some way to me.

I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too.
So the director says that the beauty and more superficial/temporal is there to be put to use and reaped somehow.
I didn't really understand the idea deep but the sequence was too obvious.

In a way the situation when the father wants to have his son tried resembles Euthyphro and possibly associates Socrates.

Also interestingly the main character actions can be interpreted differently:
- actually being this exalted and idealistic, willing to just make what is good by his own hands (he may see it this way)
- revenge against his parents (parents may see it this way)
- acheiving status by alternative means (powerful may see it this way)
