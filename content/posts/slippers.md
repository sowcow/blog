There are limited choices in my habitat.
One example is that you can't get good slippers.
Like there is a fashion that dictates slippers to be always so small that the foot gets molded by them.

So at one point I found a pair with eastern design with noses up.
I bought the biggest pair and with the pattern that can be considired stylyzed dollar signs on all sides if one wants to see it that way.

Anyway one good idea I got recently is to do walking meditation thing.
When at older times I always was looking for a manual or detailed description for such activities.
These days I just use something alike to what is called common sense.

So I was doing the practice and I thought that
monks definetly don't it
the carpet + eastern-dollar-slippers way.

Anyway it works for me and is fun.
