## What's missing

The original Avocaat Party post was written on the spot and was not as analytical but more descriptive.
Also I didn't understand the implications of it anyway.
So here, I try to integrate my understanding concisely.

## Correction

If Rosemary's Baby gives you a stab, digging into The Shining will stab you and then rotate the knife inside.
Seven months on the wagon, I think I got back to the starting point.

My sequence of understanding the movie:

1. Generally horror was caused by over entanglement in details (Jack writing, Wendy reading)
1. Then resolved by action and external feedback/connection ((director -> viewer ->) Grady -> Jack)
1. Yet it was caused by the accumulation of small errors, the lack of simple things (most of them had happened already, I assume)
1. So the movie's value must not be complex/analytical but obvious/exemplary in showing how things fail
1. Therefore, dark comedy with ghosts is a justified interpretation and digging the maze was very optional suffering.
   Jack and Wendy are the ideal parents to demonstrate how not to do things.

I've deleted the movie from all devices, so I'm not elaborating more than that.
