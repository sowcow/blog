The movie works with contradiction coming from impossibility of full truth and perfect justice.
It shows how violence defines what truth is and the dead end of that way if any justice is to be assumed.

First, protagonist dispenses violence with his version of justice/truth onto captured German soldiers.
Then he has to violently protect one-self from what he denies to be the truth, imposing this onto others.
When he himself is captured, and is surely in the corner, the last resort is violence against oneself.
What mirrors the German officer from his memories, but this time the roles have switched.

I think the movie makes an argument for ultimate justice and forgiveness coming from outside of this world.
The lighthouse is a strong, not to say violent, image signifying this point.
