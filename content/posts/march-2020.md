# General

I started some new healthy behaviors but otherwise there was no acceleration compared to the previous month.

# Reading

- I have finished small german language book that was laying around for too long
- I have started learning a new programming language so I have read a couple of books on it
- There are more books on it waiting for their turn

# Code

- I started playing with a physical engine
- I started playing with NNs
- Then I lost interest but I'm going to return this weekend
  because there are other motivating factors

# What didn't Work

Sun Tzu realy wasn't right for me. It requires certain state of mind/engagement to read for me. I can't just push through such book so I have put it off for now.

Audios also somehow are not what I'm ready to do by default.

# The Plan

I have no plan for now. I'll just continue what works.
There is no new thing I would try to incorporate at this point.
