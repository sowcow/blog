> Warnung: no grok grammar checks ahead.

Horrors often are based on unknown or unpredictable.
This one must be the ultimate horror film for me since I'm not going to watch it even.
Horrors need a degree of compulsion, well, I strongly don't care to watch it.
I like the idea of point not being a thing, so this movie is such unseen point in the previous dive into horror cinema.

Anyway in horrors unpredictable is amplified by disconnection of a kind.
Maybe reconnection is the rites of passage genre.
But there is plenty of authentic experiences about that with no need for parody of the cinema.

It is funny how as cinema is the medium so authentic experiences are the medium and not the end in itself.
