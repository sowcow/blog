First. Visually interesting without question.
I also liked characters there.
Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.

The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze.
And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.

There is this word "soviet intelligent-sy".
It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time.
And I hear this from time to time that conformists are intelligent because it is expedient thing to be doing.

The conformist in the movie is always out of place.
And often being powerless and weak for that reason.
So that smart but weak is one conflicting contradition.

And if we ignore the weak-criminal conformist presented in the movie.
More moderate versions of conformists must have some big numbers.

There was the old study with people applying current to others under supervision and they have shown high conformance so maybe the majority of population is the right measure.

I have no idea why this topic attracts me but I assume there is something to uncover so the post is unfinished...
