As any good film this documentary addresses different audiences' interests.

It could be seen as an overview and an introduction to the cinema of Powel and Pressburger also branded The Archers.
I like how creative paths of that collaboration and M. Scorsese are interwoven in different ways.
So, it can be seen as double documentary to some extent.

Of course this is not a documentary in any dull sense because the subject cinema is so creative, expressive and strong.
In 2023 BFI called the event celebrating the artists "Cinema Unbound".

Yet, I enjoyed black and white photos and stage documentary tapes here and there.
A viewer who already appreciates works of The Archers can enjoy interesting relevance and play there.

One moment that I need to look more into is that the cinema of Powell and Pressburger encodes notions of British character.

Unfortunately, you can't rent the documentary on the BFI website without a British bank card.
On Prime, I encountered some geographical constraints too.
Unable to buy British character I had to steal it.
