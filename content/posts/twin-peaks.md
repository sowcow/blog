The name of the show felt interesting, so I've rewatched the first season.
Also I had the preconception that it should be the predecessor of The Shining.
I guess one being the abstract modern horror and another being so retro and provincial made the illusion.
My verdict is that it's interestingly made but unconceptual as it is, so the peak is not even in the ballpark.

It does not mean the viewer can't find interesting allusions or some detachment in the show's atmosphere.
At one point I felt that atmosphere could have certain value as if TV turned into a fireplace and people watching it could have some common mystery experience.

But otherwise taking Lynch any seriously is an error.
I've felt so disgusted by first pages of his book that I always assume anything by him is a fraud of a kind.
If in tragedy you have the tragic flaw of a character, then this fraudulence is the comic flaw in the entertainment industry.
There must be something very American about it too, I can't allocate language more precisely about it.
