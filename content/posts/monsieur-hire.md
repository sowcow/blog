On one hand it's entertaining because it's visually suggestive and referential and it's both obvious and not forced seemingly;
so there is perceived simplicity.
On another hand, there are strong reasons for confusion about what's going to happen.
Given additional hand, I like the funny point at the end, almost a geometrical point about perpendicular lines not crossing in 3D space.
Also given added note from a shoe, the viwer must be the biggest fool in this.
