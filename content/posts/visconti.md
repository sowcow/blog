I've been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.

I decided to have some stuff written.
Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.
Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.

Also I can't be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.

### Ludwig

Very cool.
The key melody is something (Wagner - Song of The Evening Star ).

I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.
I really want to know more about Elisabeth of Austria and Ludwig for sure.
Also relation of Otto to his mother may be of interest but I beleive the movie just points to that.
It is possibly rewatcheable for me at some point.

The key conversation I think is about the truth.
The truth distant or "impossible" versus the truth "simple" and available.

### The Damned

"Machiavellian" power struggle. Evils of another level but so ordinary and distanced.
So it is like a boiling frog movie where the degree of evil gets higher and higher and sneakily in a way.
So the viewer finds themselves boiled at the end.

To be honest I had to google about the last scene.
So I got it delivered with a delay.

I beleive the director puts multiple evils to the desk at a time.
So when the viewer expects one they are less sensitive to another happened and it sneaks that way.
But then one after another there is a pile of it deposited.
But because that play you didn't expect in the end there to be this much.

### Conversation Piece

I don't have much to say for some reason.
I guess there are differences so arbitrary that even if they are wast people still have more to share with each other.

My favorite mini-conversation is about modern pictures.
In one russian version it is translated in the worst terms.

### Death in Venice

Ambiguous. There is a separate post.

### Rocco and His Brothers

Very dramatic.
At the end there is an explanation so you don't need to google :).

It poses a question of "sacrafice" in a setting where people don't change.

### Leopard

Lots of aesthetics to see.
About aristocracy that is possibly lost in the new times.
Brighter.

### Bellissima

(I can't think too straight because of fever but I need to write it to close the topic)

Unnatural world demands and even parents ideas mess with a child.
Either because mother cheats or the girl is not fit for acting from the start and the mother is delusional.

I beleive it is about miscommunication also because
I have this memory of not understanding parents.

Anyway it is about certain dignity of an innocent person.

### La Terra Trema

There are many images in the movie that you remember.

While watching it I constantly catch myself thinking: "hey! this looks interesting just visually, why are you not paying attention to it?"

So given the movie is black and white random person would not think that it should be visually interesting but it is.

So you constantly see that there is work behind this and even if you don't understand tradeoffs and choices by the director you still perceive the work as having certain quality.

I'm writing this after a couple of days after watching it so lots of thoughts and angles I can't point to now.
One thing that is shown in the movie is that labor in powerty selects for certain character of people and punishes another kind.
I guess it punishes optimists because the cost of risk is too high.
And that selecton opens opportunities for others to exploit such people.

### Sandra | Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa

I got enough for a separate post here!

### La Streghe

Natural vs artificial vs ugly.
Darker.

### Boccaccio

I remembered it as a fall.
Darker.
