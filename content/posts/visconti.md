I've been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.

I decided to have some stuff written.
Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.
Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.

### Ludwig

Very cool.
The key melody is something.

I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.
I really want to know more about Elisabeth of Austria and Ludwig for sure.
It is possibly rewatcheable for me at some point.

The key conversation I think is about the truth.
The truth distant or "impossible" versus the truth "simple" and available.

### The Damned

"Machiavellian" power struggle. Evils of another level but so ordinary and distanced.
So it is like a boiling frog movie where the degree of evil gets higher and higher and sneakily in a way.
So the viewer finds themselves boiled at the end.

To be honest I had to google about the last scene.
So I got it delivered with a delay.

### Conversation Piece

I don't have much to say for some reason.
I guess there are differences so arbitrary that even if they are wast people still have more to share with each other.

### Death in Venice

Ambiguous. There is a separate post.

### Rocco and His Brothers

Very dramatic.
At the end there is an explanation so you don't need to google :).

It poses a question of "sacrafice" in a setting where people don't change.

### Leopard

Lots of aesthetics to see.
About aristocracy that is possibly lost in the new times.
