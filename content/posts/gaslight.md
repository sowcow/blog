> Happiness is better than art.

One of the classiest things in my memory.

I expected it to feature the catchlight effect, and it didn't make me wait.
The movie is lucid and bright in many regards, so I'd not be surprised if it is considered to be a more established origin of the effect.
Yet in the arts or even technology it's not straightforward to make claims about origins, so it is more about personal experience.
In my experience, this movie is the unquestionable origin.

Also, calling movies imaginative becomes repetitive, so I'll economize on that from this point.
If things go this way, I'm going to be forced into appreciating acting at some point.
