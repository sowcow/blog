The one by Zeffirelli.
Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.

The first impression is what is called "Tube sound" in Russia at least.
So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case.
After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive
it is quality of the movie too.

Then comedy and wild story aspect got me interested to the middle of the movie.

And the end of the movie is something interesting because how unusual it is.
Also probably many people get offended.
So additionally the movie can be called controversial and experimental art too.
