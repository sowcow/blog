## Incidents

I got this mixed intuition about recent vandals activation.
They happen to act right inside walls of Western public cultural institutions.
So I wanted to untangle it.

## Analysis

My intuition (somewhat outsider) sees them as examples of hard deflection from the original Western values.
And this deflection happens at the time of bigger challenges and higher-priority issues.
And this context makes it look both pathetic in comparison and out of touch too.

I should say that I have different cultural context to say the least.
So there is a chance that among the target audience in the West it does not looks as brutally pathetic as it is.

So what I see is the combination of:

1) deflection at the time of challenges
1) distraction from higher-priority matter
1) out of touchiness, lack of ideas
1) thus pathetic look also
1) unethical in deeds but covering with words and talking about ethics surely

It reminds me something.
And is really asking for checking things out for external influence.

Alternatively I can imagine this to be a sign of exhaustion of ecological activism movement.
Because of how badly they delivered Germany into dependence from Russia 
and now hysterical denial is the only thing that is left for them?

Also I believe there is a word in the German like "verscheißen" or so
and it means to fail spectacularly and it was quite popular thing to do in some sense.
So maybe that fashion returns?

## Solution

It is easy to solve.

You are not allowed to bring dogs inside many buildings because they can do some sort of "verscheißen".
So uncultured humans should also be disallowed to enter or only allowed 
under full responsibility of an able person.

While average IQ declines you either separate the bad apples or decrease quality for good people too.
Current trend is still on devaluation.
I wonder how long it can continue.

## Perspective

As in Ukraine. Recognizing that when justice is restored and debts are paid.
Then ruined buildings and landscapes of current can be seen as monuments of sovereignty and self-determination.
Evidence of cost paid.

Vandalized pictures are the evidence of barbarians inside the gates too.
Europe has an opportunity to wake-up from the current sleep too.
And by paying the cost to build a monument of the new dawn and new epoch.
