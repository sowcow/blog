Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli.
Not in one session on one hand.
But on the other hand the second session was
something different and very fresh for me.

Alot of times the picture just looks well.
I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.

In school I didn't read stuff.
They forced stuff on us and it didn't work for me.
After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that.
Altohugh of course considering how the exerience is made overall -- not sure if my imagination is going to construct it better from paper.

But yeah - subjectively it is something both well-done and firm yet fresh.
