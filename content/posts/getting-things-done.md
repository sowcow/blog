There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.

1. The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands.
2. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.

So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons.
And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.

BTW I use org-mode to implement it.
I am happy with the proccess.

### upd: I finished reading the book.

*Concerning structure:*

1. The first part is the most useful - more practical one;
2. The second part was not that informative for me so I skipped most of it
  (because I implemented my GTD during the first part already);
3. The third part is good as well - more inspiring stuff;

*Overall:*

I liked the quotes and the language used very much.

The core content is great and very promising.
