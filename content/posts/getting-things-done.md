There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.

1. The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands.
2. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.

So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons.
And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.

BTW I use org-mode to implement it.
I am happy with the proccess.
