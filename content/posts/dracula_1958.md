This movie goes more explicitly about visuals and action.
I assume the introduction of color seduced the creator to seek ways that are more direct to the senses.

I see overlap of tools that The Shining also uses but here in a more implicit form.
Not to say that The Shining is being explicit, or less ambiguous, it's just a different kind of ambiguity.
In older movies it seems just a hint was considered enough so as not to burden the viewer.

Anyway, as any self-respecting movie this one has imagination toys here and there.
I recal the impression of a match being lit or maybe a cigarette was moved in the air.
I wonder if this one influenced Scorsese's visual language.
Also, the whole notion of a dark object in the frame, this movie is more obvious about that than The Shining.
