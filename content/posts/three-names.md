Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time.
Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website.
The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.

- one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that
- next is the English version of the name; but I'm not from England or the US
- Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally

So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion.
But then already there I used English for communication so I got to think about the naming again.

The dentist at the end wanted to write me into some visits log book.
But when I told him that I have three names he just gave it to me so I can write something by myself.
I still had to choose one but this time I also got this exceptional hotel guestbook experience.
