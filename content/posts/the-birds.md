I can't choose what I like more in this cinema.
I can enjoy both it's ambiguity and balance/sanity of how it is made.

It's a classy and original take on the same subject as Hereditary.
Hereditary does on it some funny references I'd say.

Good cinema medium is so dense and these coincidences of watching so related movies on consecutive days really makes it feel magical.
