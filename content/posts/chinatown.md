# First impression

Quality movie with meditative texture.
It gives some shallow visual entertainment in the process.
So it makes the impression of being mostly shallow too.
And there is not much motivation to rewatch it by itself.

# Second layer

Since I've heard it is a way deeper movie, I gave some scenes another look.
And yes, there is more to it, so depth is there, and it is up for rewatch at some point.

# Point

The point is that the movie entertains like a red herring type of thing, that makes you to enjoy the first layer while not giving much attention to the second.
