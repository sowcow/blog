> Spoilers or not.

The movie tries to be on the human side of things, so religious literacy is not required.
The picture definitely caused dissonance to some religious folk.

I think there is some sneaky comedy at the end of the picture.
That spirit girl is looking so sad at him and even almost rolls her eyes.
I wonder if those who got agitated and aggressive about the movie got any of it.
