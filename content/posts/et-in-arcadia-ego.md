# Context

I've got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately.
Then I've read some Gombrich and there he features the painting.
The painting straightened me up a bit.

Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer
but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself.
This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.

# Picture

I enjoyed the piece for sure.
If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findins then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well.
But I want to comment on the leftmost figure because the figure could not be understood without understanding the core of the scene.

Every figure is multi-faceted and and the left figre could even play different otherwise incompatible roles.

Possibly it plays both initial bliss of ignorance as well as certain post-factum experience.
Also my guess is that the figure plays the painter who contemplates the scene.
This way of looking at it opens the very right part for additional interpretations.
