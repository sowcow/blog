There are two videos that are related in a way.

- One is an old Ukrainian man showing destroyed military mashinery column part right around shattered village
- Another is Ukrainian civillians who have maneged to talk-off a column to take a route not through their living place

I watched the first one only and the man curses alot.
He praises Ukrainian military and curses Russian military.
While showing his house is destroyed by Ukrainians right with Russian mashinery.
You can hear that he is very confused by this.
So probably he was told in advance to leave his house so he got his life saved but now everything he knew is ruined.

So another village probably just stopped the column knowing that it will be striked and convinced the column.
Because they don't want their houses destroyed.

So I thought why would they hit houses as part of the column?
Probably for the same reason why they blow bridges - because these places become harder to pass: to slowdown.

So if my understanding is right.
Then normal civillians are basically used as hostages.

This is not normal civillians war and they don't need it.
And I'm happy to hear when they are able to save their places.
