Digital world incentives makes for some odd-looking entropy.

Things at one point can be quite good.
But then they don't grow in understandeable sense - they
may still have some reason to be attractive on one side
on another side they just devolve and get stupider and uglier
for no meaningful reason.

So you get this mixed bag.
And there is something like loss-aversion or switching cost.
Which I think is a costly intuition in these matters.

Anyway unsubscription a day keeps entropy away.
