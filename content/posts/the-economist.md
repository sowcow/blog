To call The Economist a propaganda rag would be an offence to actual propaganda rags.
Normal propaganda that targets broad human masses is obvious and in your face.
But the paper in question sits between chairs of
pretending knowledge/sophistication and repeatedly nagging about things they don't like.

I consider listening to The Economist to be like getting booster shots of some weakened COVID virus strain.
Even though it is a waste of time, you still get exposure to the intellectually corrupting virus in a controlled environment.
The propaganda injections and whines keep the attention alert, and the audio format puts timing pressure on judgement faculties.
This limited way of using it I find useful, but only until one learns all their tricks.
