Overall I avoided flying before.
So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.

I have this anchored to the planes wing.

When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me.
And that was not very comfortable mode.

Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me.
More preferable, not really escapist/non-productive or confusing I think.

Yesterday I got to think about another such mode.
Like a confusion that still can be directed and having it's own "program" on some level.

Talking about confused there is also more shallow and kind of externally confused mode.

Anyway do I have any ideas on these observations?

I expect there to be value in the ability to discern these and to navigate them.
I assume any mix that does not have the "confused" part should be great.

One very abstract idea would be to bring technical stuff closer somehow and bring oneself into
to have the first mode. I imagine it like a Mario game that is actually gamified coding for example.

Concerning the second mode I think it is about having enough own or learned experience.
Maybe improving ability in asethetics or pattern recognition can be helpful.

And the confusing ones need external culture/system/tools or training by definition.
