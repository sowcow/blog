# Ambition

> I assume any abstract description has more spoilers than any specific detail.

It's an impressive project.
One can't compliment a good thing if the compliment invalidates the experience of discovery.
But in the case of contextual references, it could be justified.

So whoever knows some Buddhism and likes finding things on their own shouldn't read this.

Roughly speaking, the reference is this: a person should guard the doors of the senses to attain the right attitude, and with the right action, achieve the right consequence (reincarnation is relevant here).
So, toward the end, "safe journey and safe return" aren’t about physical safety.
And at that point, the movie can be seen in two ways — it could be the Dalai Lama moving out or a random soldier moving in.
It's a bit of an unorthodox move but the Chinese must be red-jealous.

# Overall

On one hand it's metaphorical all around (maybe even dreamy), yet the ecstatic aspect is not lost.
I think this aligns with Northern Buddhism notions about the reality.

Overall, there is a younger audience aspect (PG-13), but it brings both internal and external politics/war and gets existential (in general sense).

The oracle is my favorite for all the wrong reasons.
