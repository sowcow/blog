On one hand it's metaphorical all around (maybe even dreamy), yet the ecstatic aspect is not lost.
I think this aligns with Northern Buddhism notions about the reality.

Overall, there is a younger audience aspect (PG-13), but it brings both internal and external politics/war and gets existential (in general sense).

And my favorite is the oracle, for reasons unspecified.
