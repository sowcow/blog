I can't take it seriously for a minute, so I watched it with considerable scrolling.
I see it as a screwed take on Space Odyssey by a Mexican director targeting Asian market, with an unstable long-legged female protagonist doing panting and screaming anime-style half of the movie.
It's a funny thing to scroll through with that perspective in mind.
I wasn't too impressed by the 3D conversion, but it adds some reflection effects here and there.
