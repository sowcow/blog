Back in a day I liked heroes of might and magic game.
Overall it was not right to get me addicted but I really liked some parts.

One thing I found odd is that there are like ten types of dragons.
Most of them I considered to be nonsensical - created just to fill some gaps in ideas.

One particular kind of dragons I liked irrationally is the Skeleton Dragon that can be upgraded to the Ghost Dragon.
I liked it on one hand for no apparent reason.
But I found it odd that you upgrade a material thing to something ephemeral and that thing gets stronger.

Move forward 20 or so years.
And today I saw a that kind of dragon in the sky.
I was Big. Kind of in the center above you.
Not a complete version but a convencing one with open jaws.
Then after a minute it disappeared because clouds got dissolved.

It looked more like a bone version but now I see the point why it is upgraded to the ghost version.
Also now it is apparent why in the game it has the lowest HP among dragons.
