First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.

The beginning predictably left me not excited.
The movie provides some words to describe it: "too modern".
And the word "flat" came to my mind too.
No idea why.
I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.

At the end of the first third you get to see some **development** and get intrigued by it.

The second part goes like a more positive part.
Where Callas is shown **at work**.
No story movement as it looks.

The third part gets to be interesting because it shows something deeper about the character on one hand.
And also teaches something I think.
The word used "integrity" maybe is what it is about.
And I'm not that good at english to correct the script.
But I think "**authentity**" is the word.

After watching I quickly skimmed through random scenes again.
And even that really quick review provided value.
I got to see that flowers are used meaningfully in the movie.

Overall the movie shows that **magical work** behind this dream producing mashine.
And I like that whether it is true or not.
Also I recognize that there is a theme of old stars and this movie takes its very well deserved place there.

I've found that journallist woman character is very likeable.

Also the movie shows zoomed faces on the screen :).
Normally this is not what I'm used to and I always shake my head when I see they do faces full-screen in average movies especially.
In this movie I was less critical and because I knew that the director is not a fool I paid attention to what is being shown.
Also I had this idea to start drawing faces just to get better at it and this movie have given me the idea to use good movies as a source for that.
I think it should be easier to choose a good shot. If you know that there is some context and directors work is there, that may make it easier to start because it may be more interesting even though less like a free interpretation.
