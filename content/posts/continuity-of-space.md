So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.

Abstract:
- time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events
- there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can't put your attention on it
- the space around us is what is actually persistent
  and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it
- active attention is what I mean in the post. It requires some more yet gratifies
- it can be bigger or smaller space and it produces it's own value

I feel like making an argument that continuity of self is
created by continuity of space around us.
And therefore architecture, trees and other environment are actually living parts of individuals that live there.

Likely this is not a new argument.

But for me the deeper understanding goes in other direction and it is way simpler too.
It is that the act of giving attention to actual space is what produces living of an individual.
