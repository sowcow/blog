So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus.
The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.

The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is
also entertaining and with a lot of humour.

I greatly enjoyed both content and perfomance.
I am looking forward to listening more by the performer.
Also there is certain Greco-Roman aesthetics that adds value.

Content-wise general spirit felt familiar (Because I am not entirely new to stoicism
and other moral philosophy).
But the core logic and argument was more explicit than what I had known.

So main points that I take from the book now are:

1. Simple core argument
1. Practice of analyzing appearances
1. Effort
