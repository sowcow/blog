Found this unintentionally and against my comfort, as everything with the movie.

Yet it's fascinating, and since it's so obscure, it's very unlikely to spoil anybody's detective work, but can fire up some interest instead.

Cartoons are a whole wing of the maze for the visual-learner type of visitor.
