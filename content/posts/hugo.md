Dreamy pace and enjoyable 3D experience.

I think it's peak 3D experience -- it's high quality and balanced regardless of certain sadness aspect.
Conceptually it's a gift of perspective at the cinema medium.

After Hugo and A Trip to the Moon I checked some books and got some cinema-related impossible dreams.
It's proof of magic there.
