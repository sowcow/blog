I can't afford proper helicopter simulator setup so I have been checking X4 space sim.
Of course it gets disgusting pretty quickly but some aspects are interesting still.

One thing is that there is opponent type named "M" and the game pronounces that with metallic female voice at random points when it's the closest next target to deal with.
I can't put my finger on what's clearly the cause and what's the consequence but I do get insights about the movie and I wanted to blame the game for the latest insight I got about the movie.

But then I must say that Hitchcock is a devious m*** hinter.

On one hand this asks for a rewatch but the movie has that against-the-fur gaslighting dynamic that I'm not looking for, per se.
But while writing this I'm getting a follow-up good hypothesis so there is no way I don't, it's just a question of time.
