My first movie of the director.
I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall.
I put there thoughts I got from it.

Scenes:
In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way
you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist.
The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start.

What recurring images or relations I noticed:
- abundance of shape or options
- lack of "meaning" or content or stable attachment or certain identity
- afaik modernism everywhere

So I think it is about lack of meaning and modernism (or there is a better word).

That "event" in the park:
- either illusory "meaning" he finds and even touches but then no traces left
- or the murder of "meaning" (by the form?)

## Other notes

- Whether there was body at all I do not know what to think
- Interestingly the guys wife come's out almost like from a painting on a wall after the "painter scene"
- The latest dialog with his wife is odd, she does not ask what she wanted to ask
- I got so annoyed by the party scenes so I really liked the scene with open window after it is finished

## Overall

There are definetly interesting scenes.
But there is one negative indicator to this movie.
I almost decided to finish it with movies for some time for no apparent reason after this one.
Quitting things that fast is not a good sign so I will likely give a try to another director for now.
