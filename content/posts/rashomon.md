For whatever reason my headset decided to play it at the half-speed.
I thought that timing goes wrong but didn't care to check properly so I thought it was a director's style decision to make it that way.
The sound is very unusual, I don't think I'm going to watch this movie normally after that experience.
And it fits the beginning so much, so I fell in love with the movie right away.

I watched this way for one hour of movie time.
And I thought the movie is pure gold.

Anyway I finished it the next day, I believe my headset started to stretch it less towards the end, but it's still plenty of fun also.
