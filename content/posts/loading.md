After getting excited by New York Stories.
I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.

I say it can't be other way.
And also it is authentic and is way more entertaining.
Doing it more deliberately could be fun too but in that case it is more demanding.
So I'm divided on the deliberation idea and it looks like a piece should be concieved with such use implied
in order to provide both freedom and pleasure to work with.
I'm not sure if David Lynch movies fit there.
