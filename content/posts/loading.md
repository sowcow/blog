I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretatians is the right thing to do.

I say it is.
It is authentic and serves the entertainment function better this way.
Doing it more deliberately could be fun too but in that case it is more demanding.
