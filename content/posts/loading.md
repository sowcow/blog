After getting excited by New York Stories.
I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.

I say it can't be other way.
Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind.
So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors.

Doing co-creative interpretation more deliberately could be fun too but in that case it is more demanding.
So I'm divided on the deliberation idea and it looks like a piece should be concieved with such use implied
in order to provide both freedom and pleasure to work with.
I'm not sure if David Lynch movies fit there.
I think any rich piece or even multiple can be mixed for something different.
Or actually good detective or even history investigation could leave the choice to the reader.
And then the reader/viewer can fill-in with own hand what is missing.

I think completeness and coherence is the quality that frees the viewer from that part of work.
And in some sense not giving that to the viewer is alike to cheating and imposing.
To compensate for that directors offer some plausible interpretation along hints for other ways.
Or otherwise there is stylistical hint to not expect coherence.
