You see quality from the start.
A movie about life and play that says it for itself.

From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them.
So there is a rewatch value added just by that.

Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already.
But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with. Only if it is timed well after other high quality content to compare to.

Overall very enjoyable especially before it gets into "complex" matters.
Then it gets into something-else but also unique in it's own way.

I'd guess that eight is females around him and relatives. And half is himself.
