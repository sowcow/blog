After finishing the movie, I saw a dream resembling Wolf of Wall Street
but with a limited palette, and it was unclear who was more high - the main characters or the more normal people around.

My take is that the movie is high.
You can see they had fun doing it.
Also it has wisdom elements and construction so I did the second watch/scroll to refine the details there.
In that lane the movie is a potent meditation on human character traits and human action in abstract.
