## Non-Stelling

First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.

Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.

Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :).

Concerning Coffee and Cigarettes.
The movie getting to be my tradition to watch every year or so.


## Stelling

I watched most of Stelling recently.

Disclaimer:
I'm not a movie enthusiast normally.
I cannot evaluate director's skill and tools they use although I can notice them from time to time.

But I like movies with rewatch value for sure and that implies they have hidden sides
that you don't recognize at first although you may have clues into them hanging around.

For example the most conspicuous mess of movies can be anything of Lynch.
It is intentionally and obviously "a salad" with very different foods rubbing each other
and the user should make sense from that their own way.

Back to the Stelling.

The Hollander is definetly a movie that takes it's unique place in your memory.
But for me the second watch (after a day or so after the first one) have provided that experience.

The first watch was not enough to put it near Lynch (by that score of being a rich food for interpretation).
Clues were there but not enough to be enchanted by them.

My memory does not hold plot stuff normally but more like unique visuals or some interactions.
There is a memorable "scene" or as I would like to say "a phrase" (Is it reading Brodsky has effects on me?).
There are sounds and non-related to the plot normally visuals that I remember.

I think that a good movie has a rewatch value soon while the memory is fresh.
