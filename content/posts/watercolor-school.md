# Before

The book is the second recommended beginner book at [handprint.com] (very informative site).

It is available at the online public library [openlibrary.com] and [archive.org].

The main goal of the post is to have notes and to review them after reading.
And to leave some info for future review.

# Notes

- buy the best quality "artists" paints and not inferior paints if you want to see vibrancy of true watercolors
- not buying the best brush selection is ok
- small natural sponge is an extremely useful piece of equipment
- consider stretching paper, use lighter paper
- never go back on wet paint

# Progress

- [ ] flat wash: on dry, on damp, with sponge(control unevenness), the water method, upside down (slight tilt, slight irregularities smooth out as it dries, drying flat)
  - observe ammount of paint needed for washes
  - observe it gets lighter when diries
- [ ] gradated wash, variegated wash (dry is easier)

# Less Relevant Notes

- I have found a place where fine text over a texture is annoying (not perfect optics but otherwise visuals seem to be attractive)
