## Background facts

I have not practiced consistently.
And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.

## Thoughts

I'm getting to know meditation again.
With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly.
Also the alternative "object" is available.
This is something new for me.
