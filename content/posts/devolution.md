It is strange that in the top politics (the US) we see
every next round hitting newst lows compared to previous rounds.

Normally in the nature even insects and bacteria evolve.
Why politicians it seems devolve?

I mean if the "IQ-descent" theory is right then it should make sense.
Then it would be cool to see nature restoring evolution back.
So that all the good political-stuff is not in the past.
