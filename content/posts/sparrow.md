Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well.
Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing.
And that I'm not the right audience for the theme overall.
And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.

During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work.
At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet. Very cool.

The movie is deeper than what it seems.
My impression is that the movie is construced in such way that strong memorable images deliver you deeper story.
And it is not one sided so you have some unresolveable core there.

One aspect is that the movie shows that people who have no access to information make bad decisions.
And it is unlikely to be about modern times because information is so available.
But one can see how in older times higher classes used religion to contain lesser classes like that stepmother contained a competitor with her daughters.

More relevant to modern days would be use of ideology.
And how possibly higher classes control lower ones with it.
And that is more possibly because ideologies operate in some odd notions spaces where there is not much of accumulated real-world information.
When you create notions and then teach others stuff about these notions in such way that they change meaning whenever you need.
You probably are doing the same to vulnerable to that people.

It may look like a digression and probably it is.
But I surely think that the movie is about classes and how they interact.

It is also about personal feelings and fears.
The movie shows a lot of cages and fences.
Zeffirelli leaves no second option about how to feel about them.
He shows that they are made not only from ignorance but more importantly from own fear.
