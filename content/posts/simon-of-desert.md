I watched alot of stuff in 2021 that I'd like to write something about just to see how it goes.
But there should be a starting point somewhere and the most recent movie is the subject of the post.

The movie is short so the post should follow the shape of the movie.

What I have seen is lots of patches with with some light humour everywhere in between.
Patches are different and that may be confusing because it looks like there are serious subjects interwoven.
But in the end humour is the unifying line.
