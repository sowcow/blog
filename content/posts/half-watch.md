I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).

It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.

Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides
similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.

I think that it works this way:
- to know the range of emotions to be expected during the second session
  one is not overwhelmed by more obvious things and can pay more attention
- processing of new characters may take-up some thinking power during the first session
  but during the second one that resource is free

As a side note I feel like range knowledge is important not only to emotions to be expected but
also to tools the director uses.
Maybe here I'm looking at it not from a "consumer" point of view.

There are memorable pictures that are left from movies.
I think watching in sessions should faciliate stronger memory response.
And that should give more ideas at the next day.

So the next logical step is to try to watch one Zeffirelli movie in three sessions to see if that delivers even more value.
