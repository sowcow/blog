The populus not liking the movie is a good omen for considering it.

Initially, I thought the movie lacked the canned laughter to trigger the public when they should laugh.
But then the movie delivered even that, so it got double laugh from me there.

It got me into artsy bait initially, but then delivered some screwed take on The Red Shoes.
So the movie makes fun of not only consumers of trashy content but also pokes the other side of the spectrum.

Not to say that there are plenty of other dimensions and relevances.
The obvious is the future of the world and the empire too given the old post-war world order being in question.
The Red Shoes can be seen as an intense sell of art as the new meaning in the world right after the war.
This movie may be seen as a more down-to-earth sell on finding a new way out of the current degenerate phase post-war order.

And this requires unbounded exploration, not to say democratic conversation (by democratic I donâ€™t mean any brand affiliations).
The movie wholly represents exactly that and laughs at all the fake cookie-cutter bread and circuses.
No surprise that the most stark consumers got alienated by the movie.
