On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions.
While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.

It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance.
Operational democracy is a demanding beast.

# Note

I don't pursue the topic systematically while complexities of it get my attention periodically.
So I highlight some aspects that look new to me but since I don't have a bigger picture yet
there is a higher risk of misinterpretation and inherent incompleteness of statements.
