I have got to drinking only water couple of months ago.
Before that I was a green-tea addict (only Flying Dragon).

And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being.
And also to compensate a bit for carbs for starters I got to drink some diet soda.

And I noticed that days with that diet soda make me feel some of that love.

Anyway this effect is based on a contrast with days of only pure water (not even tea, forget alcohol or anything else).
Also I can't say yet if there is pronounced negative effect on days off the caffeine.

Also I can say that I got something like that from Flying Dragon previously but then I just started doing it every day which does not make much sense as I think now.
No idea yet if "volatility" way of doing it is more healthy long-term than just being in a stable mood.
But short term I try to do some writing for myself and I think you need some of that inspiration this way.

Anyway it all sounds so mechanical way of talking about inspiration.
But I'm looking at it from outside-in in a way.
I get good ideas alot but I don't have structure in place to be productive in a directed manner)
And some caffeine versus only pure water days can be a part of it.
