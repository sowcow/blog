First, I attempted to watch Age of Innocence,
then the second iteration was to maybe try The Passion of the Christ.
Finally, I landed on The Wicker Man, and it was accomplished with ease.

The good part is that you don't need to suffer while watching,
and it is not entirely explicit as Midsommar or as shallow as Age of Innocence (as the first 10 minutes impress).
