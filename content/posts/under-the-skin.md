# Impression

I thought I might get Persona but got Space Odyssey.

There is this most sober female perspective on one hand, on the other hand I'd expect horror elements to contradict soberness.
I guess the odd border between horror and dark comedy and the position of the viewer on it is what defines genre of the thing.

# Ending interpretation (spoilers)

I guess the shock of the ending is that the rapist ends up being more moral/better than her.
Because he acts in accordance with laws of nature even if against laws of men, but she, however involuntarily, defies both.
