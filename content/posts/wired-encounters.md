I was looking for a project this summer so I had some random interactions over the internet.
Two of interactions had some strange quality.

One is what I recall as short and bald guy from post-Soviet territory.
He had a very attentive look as if at every moment he was looking at spinning slots.
He had a gambling project and he even said that involvement
in such projects is less ethically challenging than
being involved in prostitution business.
But then to support the claim he pulled some retro casino game box with "girl on the front cover".
He thought that the disclaimer that the casino has no age limit should support his claim.

Another encounter has got to be recurring.
A recruiter has got into a habit to call me every couple of months
for no apparent reason.
He even called me as if it was accidental call and he had the wrong number.
Even if he changed the voice I still would recognize him by the British accent.
And I watched some darker British comedies back in a day and it makes these talks to sound additionally strange and entertaining.
