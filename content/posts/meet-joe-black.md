You see the good quality there.
There is class I believe too.

One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I'm used to capture but it is definetly visible.

The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.

Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish.
At some points you may think: "What kind of dialogs are these?".
You already know what is being said but they still dictate own pace.

On one hand the topic may dictate that pace so that there is room for thinking.
On the other hand the main character may seem older because of that at some points.
Even though he is sharp at other points.
So maybe it is like how the experience looks from the inside.
You are not entirely sure in a way.

There is certain optimism and kind of human greatness in that the guy like the main character
is so experienced that he even thought a spirit a thing or two.
