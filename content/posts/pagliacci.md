Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.

Visually and overall I'm attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.
But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don't get enough of the thing you expected initially.
So one may think that the first thing was there just to
create an illusion of something new.

Anyway actually it was not only for an illusion as I saw as able to hear and see without knowledge of italian.

But anyway I don't think that two topics so different are so easily joinable.

Anyway I liked most of the content in more visual way initially.
Then I went to read libretto and got another insight.

Also during the visual part I sometimes saw that it is almost like a good time to have a photo.
Not that the content was so "spectacular" to put that into the frame as far as I understand.
But I got to believe that the director planned for certain pace of memorable-enough frames when he constructed the picture.
