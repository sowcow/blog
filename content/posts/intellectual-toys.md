I want to write an argument that there is a kind of people who like intellectual toys in certain area.

Earlier they found theology to be interesting.

Later such people were playing with philosophies, ideologies like communism.

And now such people may be writing code.

So people who are into religious fundamentalism or communism should definetly try coding.

Unfortunately in code you cannot use verbal tricks or force.
But the good part is that you are not subject to the constrains of the real world either. [^1]

And in spare time one can wage religious wars or ideological subversion on github.
