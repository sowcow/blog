So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don't have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.

Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between.
I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I'm here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place.

So I thought it is cool to have a city existing only in dreams.
I bet architectors and people who exercise their spatial abilities have very cool ones.

In the morning some recognizable but unknown piano melody was returning to me.
Now I can't be sure if it was not constructed also.

There are more unique and different enough to be recognizable types of places. Some meaning resembling real-world but modified by previous dreams is attached to these places.

I think reading fiction or even descriptive nonfiction (I should definetly check for that genre) should also give some more construction blocks for the city.
