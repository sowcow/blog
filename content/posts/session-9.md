# Movie

It's like light puzzle entertainment, you are fed little stimulants all the way, including visual entertainment, then some bigger things also get resolved to the end.
I'm relatively new to movies that just resolve without hidden corners or layers, so I need to consider it a neutral feature, if not positive in its own way.
Some parts are funny (~in a good way), the core action ain't so (in a bad way).

# Abstract

Looking into such movies makes me think that there is a unified structure behind them.
Different movies focus on different parts of it, explore different settings' expressive tools, explore alternative possibilities, have different ambiguities.
This means some details just positionally correspond between such different renderings, creating a type of "anti-reference", I guess.
So there is a layer of implicit if not accidental references that together build language of the medium.
Or roughly speaking: if you've seen only one picture, you've seen none.

To a different degree, it applies to rewatching the same picture too.

My current mode is looking into breadth of pictures, yet I cluster around the current genre or director of interest, and chunk it by sleeping.
