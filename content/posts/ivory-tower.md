I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.

They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
- clean background and possibly interesting lightening
- very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!)
- modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness)
- made in multiple shots
- narrative is delivered from this device that runs text
- narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands
- narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material...

The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.
But I can forgive them not having that because you can't have so many melodies for every course and then they will start to noticably repeat...

And given that all I also am subscribed to this trading show and have seen one inteview of one CEO there.
So the CEO wasn't looking like those coaches: all-smiling / polished-looking or otherwise styled / etc.
So one can see none of that stuff and he is more "real-world".

And then they have shown the stock chart adjacent to his face too...
Continuing 2020+ pandemic is treating their stock price badly.
It may be too late to short but who know - people with FOMO could jump right-in (just kidding :).

Anyway Later they shown marketing forecast charts to kind of correct the initial impression.

I say imperfection makes it interesting!

I'm more attracted by realness but anyway first I'll try more of those courses to have more complete impression because who knows.

Updated thoughts.

There are courses where you have everything:
- performers know what they do
- visual design is definetly there
- content is to the point

And there are these:
- performers are forced to do what they obviously are not able to do
- visually things compete for being more stained with each other
- very superficial yet diluded content

In the first case you get to learn more then is explicitly said.
In the second case you are training your patience at best or a fool at worst.

And in this case I obviously go for higher quality.
What I meant by more raw and real-world is also quality but it is different.

When I see low quality almost by intent on a platform with stuff that also has content that respects some standards I don't know what to think.

A bad product is a bad product.
Is there a paid feature to remove all the lower quality stuff?
