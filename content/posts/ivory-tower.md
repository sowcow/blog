I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.

They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
- clean background and possibly interesting lightening
- very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!)
- modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness)
- made in multiple shots
- narrative is delivered from this device that runs text
- narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands
- narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material...

The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.
But I can forgive them not having that because you can't have so many melodies for every course and then they will start to noticably repeat...

And given that all I also am subscribed to this trading show and have seen one inteview of one CEO there.
So the CEO wasn't looking like those coaches: all-smiling / polished-looking or otherwise styled / etc.
So one can see none of that stuff and he is more "real-world".

And then they have shown the stock chart adjacent to his face too...
Continuing 2020+ pandemic is treating their stock price badly.
It may be too late to short but who know - people with FOMO could jump right-in (just kidding :).

Anyway Later they shown marketing forecast charts to kind of correct the initial impression.

I say imperfection makes it interesting!

I'm more attracted by realness but anyway first I'll try more of those courses to have more complete impression because who knows.
