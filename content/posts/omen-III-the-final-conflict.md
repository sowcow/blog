It's basically the same but trying to be more mature in its madness.
The whole Final Destination franchise must be based on this series or another common source.
Personally, I prefer more foolish previous movies but they all must have at least a scene or detail that gets remembered.
I really like the foolishness ingredient, but also I like it to be surprising so I'm not certain on caricature horror movies yet.
On the other hand going dramatic raises the comparison bar, so you need to have it at the right degree.
