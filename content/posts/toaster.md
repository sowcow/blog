I thought I'd get a toaster -- maybe start my day like a civilized person.
I had to pay a bit more, so I wouldn't have to think about quality, but not so much that I'd be a fool.

So I got this Bosch in metal case (mostly).
It ended-up being metal only half-way since they had to have the control panel from black plastic.
Anyway assuming European obsession with ecology I assume it's not that bad.

But then it also turned out to be Untermensch version -- if you put in American-sized bread, it only toasts the small square inside of it.
Well, I guess now I have an excuse not to buy those big breads.

Added to that, when burned toast pops out, it produces that scratch like the girls sound from the movie.
So now, in order not to get traumatized, I have to wait behind two closed doors from it.

I'll put it in the bathroom.
