Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.

But I didn't expect that people would do worse and voluntary.
That error of underestimating idiocy of others I should stop committing.

Because of course some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.

While normally the game should be very demanding and oxygen-wise too.
But in these times having a good game is not valuable anymore.

And having been mentioned by all media for idiocy and self-torture is more important goal for such "athletes".
