April fools day is approaching.
But looking at trends this is going to be a century of fools anyway.

I thought about abstract notions like freedom, equality, security, even dignity that Visconti recently have impressed on me.

I beleive these notions if allowed to be regarded as meaningful without having them clearly defined create a bad habbit of not using reason at all and leave back doors to humans brains for more cunning ones to use.

The more abstract notion is the better food you are for priests and politicians.
