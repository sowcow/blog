I didn't follow the last American political murder attempt,
because I assume some psychos do the kind of thing.
In the movie at least you know who the ultimate enemy is,
and therefore you can have a great movie about it.
But the modern stuff is like entropy - I didn't care to watch it, however real it was.
So it should be my comfort movie about good old days.
