In the morning I looked at the the Moon movement against the horizon, spire and the clear sky.
I assume stars could be similarly useful background too.

Movement perception and image perception are somewhat different systems as scientific evidence established and that idea is already entertaining by itself.
But the subjective experience has it's own weight.

And if you are me then surely you would have five interesting hypotheses about how your
movement vector could have been biased and start writing about it
until evidence shows to reasonable degree that it wasn't.

But to the core experience.

The point of looking at the the Moon is to see how the movement is communicated
by different means while the object you perceive as moving at the same time looks as stable.
Since the evidence is conflicting the perception is felt by different pathways/means.

It is scary to think about ways in which the Moon could communicate the movement
to people with pathological imagination.

On the other hand the Moon is not lying.
Because there is that basic illusion and a blind spot in everybody's eye
and the Moon silently reminds you now and then about it.
