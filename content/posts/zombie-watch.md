Got to have a glimpse of what russian socio-patriotical channel "star" or "zvezda" shows on sunday mornings.

- first there was an episode about how many more people will have cancer in the future
- then they had one with staged excerpts related to people being executed by firing squads and how scout who was around this went into the mental house
- then they got to international politics and what prospects should be there for the state

I do not do hatewatch normally. Also I think I invented a term ugly-watch for this stuff.

No idea why this trash has found its palce an a supposedly patriotical channel.

Anyway watching this stuff can make you think very orwellian stuff is going on.
But one can't assume intention when stupidity can be the case.
