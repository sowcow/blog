On a crossroads if lights show me green before I get there - I skip this turn regardless of how much time is there.
It doesn't sound like a "herd behavior" on one hand.
But unusually this leads to me crossing the road with a crowd on every crossroads this way.

Anyway if it shows me green, instead I go check the newspapers I never check or I find something interesting.
When it gets to red I may get around but I'm not going to look at another side or to stay in the crowd.

So that day I noticed that pavement on a crossroads has certain quality.
It is almost nothing special but it gives you impression of respectability every time you make a step.
I thought that it should sound certain way that I assume but can't clearly recognize.

After crossing the road there are different statues.
One is like a tree segment. Another makes a step with big boots.

And architecture.
If architecture is still music that ascends from the pavement then how should it sound if one walks against these walls?

Another crossroads shows red and there is a minute plus.
Looking somewhere perpendicular.
Then you notice that this time it is not you who look around but it is the city that looks at you.
It looks from towers and there are windows between other buildings.
It is asking as if to entertain itself but not because it needs an answer.
A minute before green when you are perfectly content and appreciate
the connection that fills the space.
