A week ago walking through some mazes in Belgrade I found a barbershop for myself.
Family business, very authentic place and people.
What a luck!

Anyway initially I thought one of the hostesses called my haircut on the photo in the passport a "katastrofa".
Now I'm thinking it was not about the photo or maybe it was.

It was fun and I enjoyed the experience there.
Now I'm thinking about communication and more.

There is way more.
