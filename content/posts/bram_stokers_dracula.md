The movie is bleeding the World of Darkness.
Indeed, if one lets their mind see the word "undead" without clich√©,
then it's apparent how unnaturally opposite to the dead it must be.

Initially I was skeptical, but then I accepted the primal currency.
Instead of being elaborate and artificial, it goes after natural, raw, and super-natural.
And it is fundamentally flawed, yet fundamentally true.
But once you have accepted the language of senses, the mind is bound to go mute.
