The picture offers enough understated entertainment.
Not that I watched too closely, but on the obvious side are these:

- fish
- big ears
- Raging Bull clothes hanger and other small references (accidental or not)
- clock from The Shining -> cyan marriage

The picture obviously features some interesting characters.
Looking deeper into character flaws would be a different genre of content consumption.
So, I'm reluctant to dive into that right now.

Overall, it shows alpha and beta dynamics in criminal systems.

I think the viewer is more likely to identify with beta.
So those who intuitively dislike the movie are not wrong.
