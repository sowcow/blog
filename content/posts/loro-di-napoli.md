This is not the first time I see this.
But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used.
It makes things more understandable and more like communication.

So I liked how director emphasises certain places.
That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience.
Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.

Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed.

And of course I have seen some new italian gesture.
Maybe it is time to start collecting and organizing them.

Anyway there is some good fun in the movie.

All episodes are unusual.
Creators were not afraid to do experiments yet not trying to cross lines.
I liked how they put a mafiozo into random guy's house in the first episode.

Anyway not episodes are comedy.
Multiple episodes appeal to compassion to a very different degree.
Yet even in stronger and darker ones at the surface there is still
something else going on that alters the picture.
And it tells you something.

Enjoyed the quality of course.
I'm just getting to know the director but the common language is present.
