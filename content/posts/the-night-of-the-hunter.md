There is something unique about the movie -- probably all the madmen around, making the antagonist to look very fitting if not comparatively normal.
It's comparatively light movie since it does not ask for the second watch unlike some other movie.

Black and white medium has it's magics.
It's the same point as the other movie has via-negativa: about simplicity and enjoying the time together.
