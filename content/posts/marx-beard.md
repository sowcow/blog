I beleive I found explanation to what caused all the 20th century chaos and ugliness.

One could say it is human nature or nature of existance overall.
But I want to get more specific answer.

But even to say that the guy Marx started all the hastle without knowing it is not specific enough.
Because one can still zoom-in to find for more fine answer.

I was thinking about it and I think I finally got it.

It must be his beard.

The beard always felt opressed because it could only grow so much.
But the final drop was when the guy stopped coming it.
It got very revengeful and day by day every hair was being filled with anger.

When the plan riped the beard started to act.

First nasty beard startes to creep around his head until it is completely surrounded.
Then the second part of the plan is to start growing inside so it has access right inside the skull.
Finally the beard attached to the brain from all sides and started taking control of carriers thoughts.

The carrier initially got inspired by so many thoughts.
But then the beard took away all what was his own and
forged a tool for its own warfare against all.
