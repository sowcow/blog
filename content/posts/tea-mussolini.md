The movie is like a story with different aspects to it.
It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations.
But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.

One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini's table is.
Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene.
And in such a way that I started to think how it should be looked at to see stuff this way...
I even came-up with an idea about that but then I got more sober view on the scene in the context.

So it is almost like the director contrasts strong way of imposing stuff (Mussolini way)
and this light female way of imposing stuff (Sher way).

The young guy was actually excited by Sher and not by art.
And the old lady who got to beleive all kind of stuff about Mussolini is a mirror example of being a fool.

Anyway the conclusion is that trashy art is as it is even if there are people who talk trash about it in the same way as that delusional lady talked about Mussolini.

One more thing about that contrast that is shown is that females ways win over some simple males in uniform multiple times.
I saw Belorussia events and there were females demonstations.
And this was cheered by different people like something valuable.
But of course it brought no result.

So there may be some "disinformation" in this.
Although one does not normally apply such standard of informativeness to the movie it is said to be based on autobiography so that needs more checking just in case.
