I heave read about some strange practices that some marginal groups or individuals praticed.
So there was something like trying to force oneself into seeing non-existing things and not seeing things that are there.

It looks like these days there are adpets at every corner.
And they have acheived highest levels of trance.

I assume levels of subversion with the advent of mass media are so high.
That they don't need to pratice anything to get that state.
Distraction should be an important component too.

I feel like I knew how it is and then I have "fallen" from that to the good.

Reality likes to outperform fake stories.
Maybe because fake stuff is created from a limited angle on reality.
