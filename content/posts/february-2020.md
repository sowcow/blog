## Reading

Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy.
I wanted to write about it but it is not the case
that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics.
Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.

Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs.
Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that.
Even though author mildly argues for that also.

## Books

I have good stuff ready to read.
But I fell like I don't have enough focus to commit to it.

On one hand I want to get rid of small things I haven't finished yet.
On the other hand there are good bigger options that require focus/notes.

I have a book with Sun Tzu followed by 5+ other chinese old books.
I really like this content.
The plan is to have some time allocated for actual book reading.
I'll have it with chinese music also :).

## Review

Overall it looks like this blog is turning into monthly review kind of thing.
I actually considered this use earlier but I envisioned it in more data-based way.
And this still sounds like a good idea.
But the thing that is blocking me from that is that I really want to use own app for that.

And since I mentioned the app here is the status of it.
I started with simplistic ruby (it wasn't smart move).
Because I ended up either reinventing bikes or turning into standard rails+react.
And there is way more exciting idea I'm looking into now anyway (gamedev).

Anyway I have a wall calendar for some data accumulation.
So what I have is that I finally started to use my velo among other healthhy habbits.
And this happened in the last week of the month.

I am not sure if this is related to COVID-19 uncertaintry.
Or maybe also this idea that I need to write a review soon also contributed.

## Plans

1. General: Let's see if I can keep it with healthy behaviors;
1. Project: I have a crazy gamedev project idea. I have some simple next-steps and many future ideas of course;
1. Audio: I really want to try socratic dialogs by audible. They can be demanding but that is the point of it.
   Currently there is no alternative that I have in mind for the new month.
   Maybe except for german podcasts but I haven't tried them yet;
1. Video: I have some simple german videos ready to watch/listen.
1. Text: Sun Tzu+.
