Awoke and looked at the starts in the night.
Eyes may be more relaxed and sensitive at that time.
Also I assume they may move slower and movements may be less calibrated.

Some stars are clear, some are twinkling, and other are faint.
While clear stars make a space with landmarks.
Through twinkling one comes to faint and they are the interesting ones.
They are both fish and water of the night sky.

The way eye interacts with these objects is inherently dynamic.
These hazy stars almost draw your eye movements on the sky.
Sometimes you spot some flickering evidence of presence in some waters.
Sometimes landmarks appear to be moving like it is floating.
Sometimes eye draws a spark between the two.
