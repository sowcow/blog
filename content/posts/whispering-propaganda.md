Post-soviet land has it's own charm and peculiarities.
One of these is propaganda.

Today I noticed something.
Imagine hearing talk about war atrocities of your ideological opponents in a kind of whispering way from the TV.

This kind of content, even if dirty, still can make one proud of local acheivements in propaganda.

Western propaganda that I'm exposed to is not of a good taste for me.
I cannot enjoy the cheap way it is delivered.
They have a long path before them to develop that.

Although objectively my exposure may be limited.
So I'd like to see the best exemplars from there too.
Just to be able to compare in the same class.
