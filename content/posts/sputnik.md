So I got a shot of the vaccine Sputnik-V (I hope :).

Anyway I got a fever now as normal reaction.
Basically I got a modified chimpanzee virus inside which is fun aspect of it.

Another interesting aspect is that I got it at the same day (I hope :) as the first citizen of the country.

Also another reason to feel patriotic about it is that if russian people are not too eager to increase vaccination stats.
So I did a move and added to that statistics personally.

There is an aspect of doing it in own interest given how slow numbers go up and that I cannot rely on other people doing their shots.
But also while doing it I contribute to that stats.
So I felt very good after doing it.

Anyway it is interesting that the final "straw" was Andrey Movchans video (from London) where he discusses vaccines and recommends doing it in an interesting way.

I can't imagine say two years ago that I will:

1. take chips virus
2. by the advice of a financial manager from London
3. at the same day with the president
4. while feeling good about doing it

Humans are more complex than I thought.
