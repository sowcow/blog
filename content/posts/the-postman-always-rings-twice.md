First, I watched the movie with Jessica Lange.
It has dirty, raw realism and telegraphs things before they happen + the ending is the movie's strength.

Then I rewatched Visconti's rendering.
It is humorous, charming, and artful. It feels more relatable and delivers not once, but requires active imagination.
