# Context

Audible is currently having this program where plenty of Oxford's Very Short Introductions are available for free.
It ends soon, depending on the region too.
So, I'm enjoying some of that water-less non-fiction.

# Concsiousness

Another piece of the puzzle is the video on "Consciousness as a Memory System" presentation.
I saw it somewhere during the year.
I think it is generally available explanation touching a lot of interesting non-fiction topics.

Authors of the presentation also wrote a book that I have read: Why We Forget and How To Remember Better: The Science Behind Memory.

So now I got the idea to write about what I remembered from the book.

# Book

As I recalled the first sentence of it classifies the book as practical non-fiction.
Then the authors had a disclaimer that they allow themselves to do repetition, but in a very practical manner consistent with the book's topic.
So I liked the direct intellectual approach.

The second thing I remembered is how, maybe at the middle of the book, the authors go into all the ways memory loss happens.
And they go exhaustively.
Also, at that point, you saw and know the names of different brain parts.
So there is some content for imagination.
Which a reader may want to try to control during this part of the book.
What makes it a bit of a tense reading.
So, the authors produced suspense in the non-fiction work.

The release of suspense needs to be earned by reading through.
And the content is not fake in any way.
What adds to the quality.

So it is not only practical non-fiction, but also educational suspense.
