My intent was to have a look at some raw nature from a safe distance.
Then the "protagonist's" eccentricities got my interest.
But then you see that the whole thing is a trip â€”
so "Who is sane in this?" is the one thing I can say about it.

They should send the movie with recordings into space, so aliens can have a look.
Hopefully, they don't destroy our planet after seeing this.
