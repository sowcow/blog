# Un (process spoilers)

To me, it's some advanced horror with a timer.
As with fireworks, in case of accidental explosion, a small, controlled follow-up explosion may calm the nerves.
This means rewatching the first half of it now (the next day) and then whether/how/when to watch the Sorcerer movie is some question down the line.

# Deux (concept spoilers)

- Not an intentful reference but SOC in Russian translation sounds directly like juice.
- I always like to encounter translations into Russian from European languages that do have more juice than often dry English subs. In this case only one tranlation got it but multiple other translations and the English subs I've seen just failed to get Donald Duck reference.
- One question to AI and this good reference comes out: de leurs épées, ils forgeront des socs.

Second half-watch worked well.

So I watched the Sorcerer also...
I'm glad I didn't wait because it's such a parody.

If the original movie is a bowl of Foie Gras then this is French fries soaked in ketchup.
I assume the director made this as psychotherapy after watching the original, but he lost the whole point and instead loaded it with everything from Palestine to anime.

So the rule of thumb is to always watch the original movie first.
This way you are immune to bullshit in advance.
