# Un

To me, it's some advanced horror with a timer.
As with fireworks, in case of accidental explosion, a small, controlled follow-up explosion may calm the nerves.
This means rewatching the first half of it now (the next day) and then whether/how/when to watch the Sorcerer movie is some question down the line.

# Deux (references/abstract-spoilers)

- Not an intentful reference but SOC in Russian translation sounds directly like juice.
- I always like to encounter translations into Russian from European languages that do have more juice than often dry English subs. In this case multiple translations and subs just failed to get Donald Duck reference.
- One question to AI and this good reference comes out: de leurs épées, ils forgeront des socs.

Second half-watch worked well.
