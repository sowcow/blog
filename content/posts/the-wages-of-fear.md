To me, it's some advanced horror with a timer.
As with fireworks, in case of accidental explosion, a small, controlled follow-up explosion may calm the nerves.
This means rewatching the first half of it now (the next day) and then whether/how/when to watch the Sorcerer movie is some question down the line.
