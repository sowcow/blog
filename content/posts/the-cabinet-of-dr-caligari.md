I like how Shutter Island is already there in an early form in this movie.
From this perspective of continuity, there is a point in watching/reading within those strains to see the development.
Of course reading/watching a specific creator also has a value.
In both cases one gets a more complete picture I think.

I think, I'll deal with Silent Cinema and Scorsese concurrently.

# Favorite Scene

I really liked one scene.
On another hand I need to try to continue the tradition of writing bad reviews for good pictures.
Well, I liked some interior design in it.

# Abstract

The type of ambiguous art that is good at posing questions.
Anyway, giving answers is the job of the viewer.
Other pictures may be seen as detalizations or versions of alternative answers by most attentive viewers, who also produce those answers in the same medium.

The thing to consider also is the oppsite side of the spectrum.
Pictures that do not pose questions.
I need to find one like that.
