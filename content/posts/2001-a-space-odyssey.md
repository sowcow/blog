The simpler/more-explicit movie so I'll try to stick to just first impressions.

I expected the movie to be about cardinal topic.
The topic is human state and experience.

# Spoilers if you like

The topic is shown from two angles overimposed: intelligence and reproduction.

The black rectangular prism means evolution crossing some limit.
All four key appearances signify something fundamental to human experience.

- First: "monkeys" get natural intelligence evolved
- Second: superficially - artificial intelligence gets discovered, but I'd say there is more to that AI
- Third: is experience of body generation complexity
- Fourth: is limit of unacheivable by every previous generation

# Overall

The movie feels very humane at certain moments dispite it being not the most cozy watch.
Understanding the whole thing makes it a comedy too.
This makes for an interesting depth in it.
