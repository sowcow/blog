Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock.
Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.

Some theories on what happened:
- Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash
- stock offering
- profit fixation on the main session

A lot of hamsters (including me) who missed the tesla hype expected the SPCE to became the new one.
And I beleive that accounted for bigger than normal swings.

It was interesting time in russian virgin-sect random trading circles.
Fun quote: "So 20% up by the night is a side movement for you?"
This quote made me realize that you cannot ignore that and not fix it even if you wish for some other mark.

Overall everybody is so negative about the stock movement now that I cannot dismiss it for sure.

Anyway I still love the news-orientedness of the stock and can't wait for something new and cool my the company.
