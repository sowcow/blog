Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock.
Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.

Some theories on what happened:
- Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash
- stock offering
- profit fixation on the main session

It was interesting time in russian virgin-sect random trading circles.
Fun quote: "So 20% up by the night is a side movement for you?"
