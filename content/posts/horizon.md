Checked OED and Britannica as I have them. Also asked ChatGPT a bit but it wasn't useful in this regard.
One definition of horizon is a boundary line at which the earth and sky appear to meet.
Other connotations are: boundary, limit, stage/level.

Add the notion of planning/time horizon and the difference it makes to how mind processes things.
And this makes things interesting.
This has to be a profound idea or image at least.
I'll keep it as is.
