NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well.
But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially
to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching.
Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.

Due to my misunderstanding comments on the internet were odd so I wasn't excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.
But actually it was a good movie for me.

- Visually I liked this strange palette (no idea if it has a name but I assume it has).
- The movie does not contain reading poetry.
- It has some comedy and some stuff that seems to be absurd but there should be more precise way to describe it

Arthur, the main character is non-ambituous simple man, kind of ignorant about other people.
Probably disillusioned in some sense but having incomplete picture.

Probably by own folly he gets around low quality people and into trouble.

Then by the system he is being put down and executed more for being different.
And even more for not pretending to be like those who populate the system.

---

He does not care much in the beginning of the movie but events force him to experience different affects:

- love
- restlessness
- calmess based on deeper understanding of life
- and contempt based on ugly lows that humans can reach

But he experiences all that too late - soon before he is executed.

---

The character reminds me of myself at different points.

- sometimes I did not pretend where others would do, being more straight forward
- I got to be around low quality people at some point
- some lack of ambition or vision for the future

Although my lack of such kind-of-social smarts is of another nature and I think I have less simpicity (ignorance?) than the Stranger during most of the movie.

---

Interestingly that simpler random people: pimp (afaik), imprisoned arab, a dog owning gentelmen.
They treat Arthur better than those who are part of the system even if rightous and in authority.

So in a way this movie pushes me to redefinde what I consider to be lower quality people.
So even that pimp is a better person than those involved in the execution.
