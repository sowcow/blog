## This time

So I was about to visit a dentist today.
It was my last visit in this "session".
And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.

And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anesthesia
it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.

And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.
But I wasn't sure if I will really decide to not use it.

In the end the decision was not that hard.
And I got two observations from it.

### 1. Danger overrides pain

(needle + hard to access tooth + recollection ~ danger);
Experimenting thing would not overwrite it in my case. I am not that hardcore.
But it was not danger by itself what informed my decision.
It only kept me from flaking :).

### 2. Middle-ish-intensity not-long pain was more like an attention signal, not like something important at all

I was focused on two other things - jaw position and throat state.
So pain was more like a signal to give attention there but there was nothing unexpected anyway.

## Some previous time

I do not plan to have a series of dentist posts at this point.
But I'd like to record previous experiences as well.

One was when I was really affected by it.
So I felt like I'm surrounded by enemies and every time after they were stopping
I had to remind myself that everybody around is acting in my interests as well.
I probably also was kind of vividly focusing on pain and what exactly they were doing.
And you get some kind of high after it is over.

Another time I got anesthesia and it didn't really work.
So I felt it but I was content.
Either because I was relaxed because I expected it to work (and there was nothing else to do anyway).
Or because the nature of that anesthesia - but that is unlikely.

## Summary

- experimenting/relaxed mindset is probably a good idea;
- pain fear/avoidance is overrided by expectation of danger;
- keeping track of dentist but not focusing exactly on their "working area" but on other bodily matters instead seems to be a good idea;
