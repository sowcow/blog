I don't have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.

The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental "images" that I like for some reason.
I assume they can be "mine" but I'm not that sure in my memory to be certain.

If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point.
But what exactly is the points I don't understand yet so this page may help me in that.

NOTE: so how they say: "trigger warning: don't read stuff below just in case" :)
