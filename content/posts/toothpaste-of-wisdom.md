My tooth pase every day recommends me to save water.
The problem is that I have a couple of bottles saved
and they stand on a visible place too.

So I follow trends and all that
but my paste keeps demanding more...

So I thought what if I buy not the cheap paste
but some premium version, will the banner disappear?
Or at least can I get a better more premium-customer advice then?

For advice on how to save sanity it is already too late
but maybe tips on how to save time or money would get attention.
Also these tips should be new every day.

Like you squeeze-out rolled pieces of paper and they give you
financial advice.
And when you need it in the middle of the day, you know - just use a toothpick:
"Buy the dip!" and all that.
