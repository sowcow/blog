I'm glad the guy got some sleep to the end of the movie.

Also enjoyed the insightful commentary and got an idea for visuals in the process.
At one point, the script writer uses the word "racism" around eight times, which is a lot of repetition, and as a writer, he should know that.
Then he says how they were searching for a reference white pimp in NY, but didn't find one.
