I have just returned from a walk.
On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing.
I tried to look at it and wasn't able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow.
So these "golden-hats" the church has make it possible to see it even further.
I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.

There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays.
It is complaining-type propaganda on the TV talking about the west for sure.

They have money and certain ugly-type creativity so you get to see interesting stuff.

For example in one show they have one light source in the frame: behind the talking head sitting behind the table and leaning forward.
So it resembles some kind of old-school interrogation with a lamp in your face where all viewers are in that position.
I assume soviet people like that kind of stuff in the more modern setting.

Today the propaganda complaining about the west item was guns in the US.
Given the crime stats here one would assume they should not talk about things like that.

So you can't teach somebody how to make cookies when your are incapable of making your own.
(This odd example I took from a random youtube writer)

But no. In propaganda as in the real life rules are different.
Plumbers teach making cookies.
Painters complain about laws.
Lawyers talk about pets.

I believe there is some kind of absurd aesthetics to it.
I guess I need to watch some absurd comedy because it has more to reality than what I'm used to lately.

I believe local propaganda may have opened a new layer of perspective for me when I watch conventional stuff.
But I probably don't have enough attention already while watching stuff.
To also capture that second-level absurd is just like another tool I'll check/see from time to time.
