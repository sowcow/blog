I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow
but it always finds a way to astonish you.

I don't know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective.
I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I'm so used to like.
But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation.
It is just that odd and in a way immutable.
This way of looking at it seems new to me.
