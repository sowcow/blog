I decided to finally check on how smarter animals organize their groups.
I decided to start with ravens because they came to the mind recently.
This one was the first that came-out of the google although I know there is a recommendation on this kind of books that I need to dig-out.

I'm in the beginning and there is that feeling that I'm not going to be told anything organizational.
Because the book goes into details on peculiar stuff that is cool from another point of view.
But otherwise the author keeps me starwed well like his ravens in aviary.
He makes a picture of different obstacles there to find-out this and that.
And there are interesting bits of what I wanted too of course.

To be continued...
