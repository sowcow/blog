I only watched the English version now.
It's low budget project but I felt that Hein Heckroth's involvement was a sufficient reason to check it.
And it delivers effectively at times. I say it delivers right away early on even before saying a word.

Another point is that it could cast some more light on Peeping Tom main character.
And yes, there is a match.

But overall I'm not conclusive yet.
I'd need to re-check Peeping Tom and German version first because right now the subject feels alien to me for unknown reson.
