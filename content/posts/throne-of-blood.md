One characteristic childhood memory I have is, when I asked why Chinese have narrow eyes,
I was told that because they are smart,
so I started to walk around and operate with my eyes as closest as possible.

I think some far eastern, concise, ambiguous/imaginative, probably explicitly wisdom/educational stories impressed me at some point.

Throne of Blood, even if it is based on Shakespeare seems to be distilled in that minimalistic style.
Even black and white format supports the austerity.
