I hope this blog is not going to be corrupted by politics too much.

One can sign a propaganda plakat.
But one cannot sign a word.
How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.

Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones.
Words like "free market", "pro-choice", "ABC rights", etc...
Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.
