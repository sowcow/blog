I liked how the picture was made; it is necessary to see it from that perspective.
But as it happens when the viewer reduces the picture to their own level of thinking,
I shall proceed and make this post about alcohol in movies I saw relatively recently.

There is so much alcohol in Casablanca that movie disc boxes should be tagged with excise taxes.
I don't know if that final bottle drop has any subconscious effect from that perspective,
but I observed some dynamics in my own relation to alcohol that was changing with the level of conscious understanding of other pictures.

I assume Jack having drinks in the bar scene from The Shining made Stephen King's throat dry.
Despite the kind of reduced look of Jack in that scene,
I myself got an idea to maybe check the brand, even though it is not my thing in any way.
Then when I got to made 2+2 about different details of different scenes,
I found strong negative reinforcement against alcohol instead.
But I think it only worked when I found things consciously.

So what I'm saying is that movie is both an ad and anti-ad, depending on the level of detail you see.

Another picture is Cape Fear.
I don't believe it features any ad-like alcohol scenes, which is good.
But then if you look across, considering either both movies, or book background, or general human thing,
then you could interpret the final scene with alcohol in mind as one aspect of reality packed into the scene.
If you can see that, then it's negative reinforcement on par with The Shining.

Anyway, I lost interest in trying brands or anything at all.
What got my attention is that the effect required conscious recognition/interpretation.
So my own sample suggests that recognition at a conscious level is a requirement for virtuous advertisement or propaganda.
