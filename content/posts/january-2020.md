I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn't write about anything interesting.

Although I have started listening to Chesterton's Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy.
I'm not doing it methodically and I'm not really in
control of personal time now.

So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.

First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like
and then I move to something else.
This time I plan to simplify it so much that
it does not involve trying some exciting and unknown
technology.

So basically I'm going to write ruby terminal app for personal
consumption to see how it goes.
The only exciting thing (outside ruby itself, but I know it well enough) is the
new typing system that I haven't had an opportunity to try
yet.

I have a lot of ideas so this is going to be fun.

And there are two aspects to the app.
First I'm going to be able to analyze patterns and try and see what works and what not.
And the second aspect is that the writing of it in predictable technology space itself should be a way to
reclaim some dedicated time for personal projects (I'll just start with just one pomodoro a day at the fixed time and see how it goes).

BTW. I've go my first month on a new project as my first actual full-time remote job.
Technology used there is not exactly what I'm good at but it goes well.
And the interesting part is that I got it on 31-th of december and there was so much randomness involved.
And if I didn't get it I would had to get something in-the-office.

Anyway the point of this blog is more about personal development stuff like reading.
Because coding I can do but reading and other niceties on the list require some special organization from me.
