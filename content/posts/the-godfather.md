# Overall

I watched the first two parts of the trilogy, and the beginning of the third felt a bit too light for me.
Then the third also gets more understandable for me.

The first part seems to be my favorite due to its humor and conceptual elements.
The second is remembered for horror elements and overall the form of parallel if not comparative narrative.
The third part plays with false memory, feels less detached, and explores grander theme of Godfather coming to believe in God.
Maybe it even grounds the image of orange as a symbol of original sin, but sin for power instead of knowledge.

# Reflection

By comparing some English and Russian audio fragments, I found that the original English experience was way more connected and insightful.
This got me thinking that English is my more analytical language, while Russian is more about humour, absurdity, and poetry.
The English word "horror" primes me to recognize visual clues and references to the genre's visual language.
The Russian counterpart word "uzhas" (it's even pronounced on the opposite side of the vocal system) primes me for trashy humour and parody.
"Fear, I suppose", as a phrase, has that confusion halo.
I may like the visual mask of face of fear, but can a plain visual capture the action aspect implied?
I think yes.
