Four months since the first conscious meeting with The Shining,
and I'm still afflicted by solving aspects of it.
Even though I took a break at one point, now I think I've changed my approach.
My approach now is more goal/question-oriented, so it is more constrained.
Still, the movie can even enter dreams in some abstract way.
So I'm drawn to look into abstraction, and it gratifies, I think.

There were some interesting photographs posted recently, so it is a good point to report on the progress(ion).
While also pouring some reds into the blog.
