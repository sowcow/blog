Watched the piece again and saw some of it's riches.

The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called "unveiling".
Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa right there.
But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.

Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.

Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don't know why yet.
Is it another echo? But this one is subtle enough to puzzle you whether it is there.
