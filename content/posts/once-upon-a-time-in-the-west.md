I've watched it with unmeant overtones around the early Claudia Cardinale scenes.
So the timing of watching was strange, and it was the first watch.

The Western genre seems to offer directness but not at the cost of imagination, wit, and humor.
Of course there is also the metaphysics of the time and the place.
But I like to see/infer actual human experience that is packed into the artifact of cinema.
And given the ambiguity of the medium, it seems to be delivered relatively directly.

Anyway this exact truth behind the picture is what I should look for more intentionally,
I tend to find these almost by surprise, and it must be the main engine behind the picture, while everything else is decorative however necessary.
