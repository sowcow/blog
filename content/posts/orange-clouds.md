This post is like a smell of a level-up of a kind.

For some time I wanted to write a post about where this simple writing experiment got me.
Surely interest in arts is involved too.

What got me to that idea is that everytime I go for a walk I see something new.
Something worth recording or trying to analyse in a post.
So there is plenty of simple-looking experiences
but in limited time non obvious how to approach in a contained way.

Whether the sky is a blast or mute.
Whether snow is blue, white, green or red.
Or fog.
Or maybe you meet a tree in the winter that is like fireworks.
Why the sunset is green?

Lots of posts remain frozen in the air.

I recall in Antonioni's movie that starts in the clouds in the final monogolue.
There is the idea that behind every directed picture there is another picture that is more true to reality.
And then there is more.

So I'm thinking that I need to record these observational posts at least in draft mode.
And then possibly compose pictures when the occasion is right.
