So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.

First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks.
And I holded them.
Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.

Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold.
And missed some good actual run from that point.

Then in november or december I was in cash waiting for crash :).
Got some long-term SPCE position because of the new frontier and possible future value of high-technology used there.
Also I tried some dividend stocks at the time.

Then by comparing what didivend stocks provide to what SPCE jumps do I got totally converted into growth stocks overall and SPCE specifically.

Then I just bought and hodled.
So until this time I missed three good peaks and yesterday I sold not at the peak but at a rational price anyway.

TLDR my path:
- holding -> fixing
- fixing -> holding :)
- hodling -> fixing, not being married to a stock, rational approach

Or another angle:
- dividends idea felt good -> growth stocks are the thing
- married-hodling a paper for gainz -> rational measured approach
