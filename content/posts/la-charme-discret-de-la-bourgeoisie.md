I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.

Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.

I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.

Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
