I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.

Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.

I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.

Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.

The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is.
One random phrase can be just so fun.

Or consider a bishop playing with a sickle and then demanding union rate, no more, no less.
That is both fun and is relevant too.
Because it is actually how quickly that kind changes their allegiances when times change.

And also interestingly that sickle scene can get even get another light on it for a second in view of future scenes.

Also that chairs scene can be viewed in different perspective.
And I like that.
I like this ambiguity yet rich food for interpretation.

And puzzles like that are not expected to be resolved while meeting them for the first time.
Yet this one has a very light atmosphere unlike the reference ones for me.
So probably I need some more exploration among that kind.
