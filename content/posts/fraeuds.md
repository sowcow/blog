I have a strange relation with this type of content.
I may get attracted to availability and perceived richness of content.
But then I'll get discouraged because it often may end-up being some story-telling.

Anyway social skills have a good marginal utility for me so I got to check what is there on the surface.

One book named "Surrounded by Idiots" was reviewed as being very useful for the HR and managerial crowd.
