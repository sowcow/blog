I watched some of it.
I'll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.

# Other

The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.

The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure.
(I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn't really live through that time. But probably like here in Russia people still affected and see communism stuff even if they haven't actually lived through it)

There are other parts that are more like cold documentary that document some old places that look like there was a nuclear blast.

And one part has stuff like new stadiums and electronic music - the stuff was new at that time but this makes it look cheap and irrelevant for the modern viewer.

I don't know who allowed one of those no-name directors there.
But that director just randomly shows you ugly stuff with annoying sounds on the background.
I guess this stuff was called experimental art of the time or so.

I should say that given all errors they commited there I still like that "diversity of errors" - they all are understandeable.
In that sense the movie having these different questionable parts still gives food for thought.
Especially if you have the good part there too to contrast them all.

# Worthy

The part by Zeffirelli is something one cannot miss.

Preceeding directors moved the bar so low that I started to think that it is me being sick at the moment is what is making me so critical.
And then I decided to just write a realy nasty post on them so I continued watching just because of this.

But Zeffirelli moved the bar to its highest so I rewatched and started writing the post.

In short:
- The director is very visual as always;
- The music is beautiful and elevating;
- There is meaning;
- But it is not cast in stone. It is interactive: you are provided with a light puzzle, an open question, but not with some pre-cooked thing.
  If you see multiple interpretations - rewatching provides you with more keys;

It starts with almost black and white hazy scene of playful florentines.
They cast long shadows on the mist.
The ball enters the scene from a side and they play with it.
There is a moment when the moon is visible behind one of them.

They kick the ball into the future where youth play with it and a priest is shown to be favorable of them.

While different generations play with the ball you meet high cultural acheivements of florentians.

Later things change and the game gets messy.
To the end you see fighting and flying sand resembles mist at the start.

And the ball is taken from them by gods as it was given to them too.
