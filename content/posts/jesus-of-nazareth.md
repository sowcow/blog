I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.

- like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots
- also some interesting shots overall
- there is some flavor to judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions
- like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going
- I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too
- unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial)
- in that "surrounding" Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad
- and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist

Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.
