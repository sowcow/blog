I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.

- like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots
- also some interesting shots overall
- there is some flavor to judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions
- like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going
- I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too
- unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial)
- in that "surrounding" Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad
- and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist

Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.

The second session started with a dialog that got me initially to loose interest so I postproned watching for a week.

But on the next attempt I was exposed to death because of the continued pandemic.
And that made part of the dialog more undestandeable from the point of what the director wanted to show there.

Then the first grown Jesus appearance was a well done challenge for the director too.
He showed authority without external stuff like what John or Herod project.
Also interestingly the director left two points where the viewer can see that Jesus almost communicates to John about future events: when John reflects on it and when later disciples talk with Jesus about the event.

Anyway I loved the second episode.
Lots of visual meals.
As always vicious ones have the most interesting scenes IMO.
To the end of the episode Judah is being introduced.
Since I don't know the details of the plot I'm getting intrigued what kind of meals will the chef serve next :).
