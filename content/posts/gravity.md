Watched the movie.
It seems more balanced than Interstellar.
It has both soapy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that stuff).
But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.

It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.

It has some of what can be arbitraly called psychological.
Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense.
But later she does redefines herself against memory and negative experience in a positive sense.

I liked it in the end even though in the beginning that childish behavior of Lara was too conspicuous.
I guess some people can't see the movie without being focused on all inconsistencies to laws of physics of the action.
But I think it is like in any art -- you bend the rules enough to be able to show what you want to show.

Also it is not only more balanced and less cliche that Interstellar.
But also it seems to be deeper and more unified yet faceted if you ask me.

It is just more convincing because it has less noise and complexity of the story I think.
