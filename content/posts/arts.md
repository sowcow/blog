### Disclaimer

I'm totally amateur in all this stuff so this "early" perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.

### Music

Music was one of liberal arts education subjects.
I strongly feel that it is for a reason.

On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it
offers certain hope and positive expectations.

On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.
If being developed I think there can be similarities in perception.
So on the other hand it is as perceptual development as other arts if I'm right.

If that theory is pushed that I guess it is possible for music to have countours.
And then for trees or clouds to have own sounds.

### Movies

Also good movies.

Just by watching what director arranged artificially you get to look at things from a fresh angle.
So cool stuff can be found where it is not supposed to be.
