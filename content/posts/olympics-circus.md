Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.

But I didn't expect that people would do worse and voluntary.
That error of underestimating idiocy and comedy of real-life I should stop committing.

Anyway some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.

At least now I know that the game is not as demanding physically and oxygen-wise as I thought.
But also everybody got entertained by this new equipment.
