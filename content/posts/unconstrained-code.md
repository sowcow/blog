I was looking at what I am doing wrong with my personal projects recently.
And I think that part of the problem is this unconstrained approach.

So there is the propensity in people to be blindly optimistic about something.
I found mine to be interfering with the code.

So I gotta learn some good constraints.

I'll try some very directed and formal approach with explicit principles and compromises.
