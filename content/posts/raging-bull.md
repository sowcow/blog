I think there was general context of hearing how this was one of the movies notably influenced by Powell and Pressburger cinema.
The movie's title sequence by itself confirms that art-cinema aspect being there.
And actually it confirms the reference, if one wants to see it from that angle.

Watching it from that perspective ain't satisaction guaranteed kind of entertainment, but it actually gave me some enjoyable parallels.
And that development and difference compared to the reference tool used is what enriches overall cinema experience by structuring it more.
Also it gave some of own picture's language that could be missed without that kind of attention.

Anyway, I think this movie is like it's own animal unlike some ideally casted creation.
That's why I enjoyed different perspectives and insights from commentary material.

So even though I appreciate those clear artifacts of pictures.
This movie, for me, is not just the artifact itself; but it is like a scene.
And different stories of different people anyhow involved in it show up here and there.
