It has another level gaslighting with catchlights.
Also birch trees are my favorite.
Overall, it's hypnotic yet plain.

Unlike Midsommar, this one is not funny.
Yet there is still the sacrifice aspect, but the negative perspective.
I assume it's The Wicker Man one way or another.

Of course it's also alignable to the unnamed here movie.
One interesting difference I noticed on the first watch is that there is a lack of a defined sense of smell.
This invisible lead can be connected to different things, but generally speaking I'd say Midsommar answers that.
