# Impression

It has another level gaslighting with catchlights.
Also birch trees are my favorite.
Overall, it's hypnotic yet plain.

Unlike Midsommar, this one is not funny.
Yet there is still the sacrifice aspect, but the negative perspective.
I assume it's The Wicker Man one way or another.

Of course it's also alignable to the unnamed here movie.
One interesting difference I noticed on the current/first watch is that there is a lack of a defined sense of smell.
This invisible lead can be connected to different things, but generally speaking I'd say Midsommar answers that.

# So

Sacrifice is the most interesting perspective for me now.
Thanks to the volume of 20th-century propaganda or even 1 AD, there is informational poison of the notion of self-sacrifice.
But like a snake eating itself, self-sacrifice is bound to fail, because the actor loses the human being status in the process.
And they all lose the status in the movie.
Only Charlie does something like the proper sacrifice.
And for that she is let out of the choking world of the movie early.

That thing being disturbing is a question to cultural environment and the reason such genres prosper.
