Jeez what a picture.
The most devious spoilers coming along.
The reader must close this page immediately,
at the risk of breathtaking details being revealed.

If you have read to this line,
then this is the last warning.
I repeat: this is the last warning!

Ok, so you have crossed the line.
Now all bets are off.
But be careful, because on the judgment day you may be asked: "Did you watch the movie? Or did you read about it?".

There is an odd comic or early animation allusion that's too vague to say for sure.
It is very disturbing when one can't be sure whether reference is being made or not.
But I tie it back to the movie itself.

So it is a movie of small things.
Smallest thing that works quite a bit is the blood clot causing the heart disease of Humbert.
But it is as metaphorical as it gets.

In Pragmatics of Human Communication, the authors qualify the key scene as disqualification of communication.
I intuitively would call that people talking in different frames and not having the common frame.
But then what brings them together?
A bullet and a blood clot.
Now that's design.
