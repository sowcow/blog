Threre is this blender-question related to apple hiring.

Initially I thought: "what a stupid question":
- amygdala stuff at the core
- incomplete and nonsensical context

So in abstract this question primes for stupidity.
Although in the context of hiring interview I assume that
primes for some creativity.

I have no idea if it is useful in the hiring context.
But in abstract it is like an ugly but educational toy.
Because it demonstrates how amygdala-driven decision making is not useful.
While on the contrary most conventional ways produce better ideas.
