Threre is this blender-question related to apple hiring.

Initially I thought: "what a stupid question":
- amygdala stuff at the core
- yet professional and social situation
- incomplete and nonsensical context

I have no idea if it is useful in the hiring context.
But it is an interesting and educational toy to entertain.
Because it demonstrates how amygdala-driven decision making is not useful.
While on the contrary most conventional ways produce better ideas.
