I think the movie is meant to give general impressions, without making too many points.
This means that somewhat loose characters and plot are just what they are.
I say characters and interactions are not meaningfully reducible because this is not The Irishman, where you have plenty of time to analyze.
Mean Streets is a completely different world.

Having said that, I can see it as a comment on the misuse of religion,
and the obvious character development is: "queen getting balls".
So I see rewatch value now.
