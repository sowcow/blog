During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings.
They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.

In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein.
I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.

First is obviously similar short form.

Second is political angle.
As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time.
Igor Guberman writing is more open and costed him imprisonment in Soviet Union.

Then the ultimate inheritance that surprised me the most was visual.
It looks like a drawing by Piet Hein was interpreted by Igor Guberman and then applied to create a new piece that is still relevant to Russia.

# by Piet Hein (translation for consistency)

Лишь шутку в шутке замечать<br />
И лишь серьезное в серьезном –<br />
Воистину не различать<br />
Ни одного в единстве розном.<br />

# by Igor Guberman

Напрасно телевизоров сияние,<br />
театры, бардаки, консерватории:<br />
бормочут и елозят россияне,<br />
попав под колесо своей истории.<br />
