I watch somewhat technically, considering references in the process and freely having breaks for whatever reason.
This movie is considerably dark and it's the first time I thought that by having breaks I might reduce the experience/immersion aspect.
It's funny how I noticed this cheating only when I decided to switch the genre anyway.

I may be getting somewhat gaslit by the genre with its demand for attention and guessing.
Yet I'm reluctant to switch it now since it is such an insightful genre.
I'll have to balance the imaginative part by maybe more perceptive volume.
Exact borders between activities too.

Anyway, the obvious thing with the genre is that it is messing with the viewer.
And this movie has something to show off and generally keeps you on the lookout.

Secondly, each movie refers to predecessors and either uses expectations or builds something new upon them.
This movie uses them plenty of times.
Particularly the movie I decided to stop mentioning.
And there is build-up toward the end.

I definitely see why Marty recommended it.
I can even see how he influenced the movie.
I really like seeing this rolling snowball action; it has so much explanatory power.

The big picture significance of this movie is that it joins the unnamed movie to quite an old story and does it so naturally as if there is this natural fit.
While the unnamed movie is so hazy, this one goes very primal and direct.

Movies can be seen as making arguments in the conversation between different previously created pieces.
This movie is a direct, primal occult-to-spiritual claim.
Spiritual claims are not small matters and this is where the arts shine.
