# Point

Experiments reveal something about the subject.
Among other things these three definetly have the viewer as their subject too: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut.
Also those movies are talked about more broadly than understood, so this makes for some interesting social experiment.

My observations at this point:

- people use different strategies and faculties for solving these movies and it is very contextual
- there is almost a protection mechanism around the "truth", that is "understood" by all parties, in part because "high" is realized in executing those strategies, not in completing the search

# Context

I'm lately thinking about the idea of shadow archetype-wise very abstractly.
Looking into these dynamics is in a way that shadow area for me.

I consider interpretations of Eyes Wide Shut to be more degenerate than the content at it's deepest.
But the real sewer of interest is the dynamics that produces them.
