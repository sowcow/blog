Experiments reveal something about the subject.
Among other things these three definetly have the viewer as their subject too: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut.
Also those movies are talked about more broadly than understood, so this makes for some interesting social experiment.

My observations at this point:

- people use different strategies and faculties for solving these movies and it is very contextual
- there is almost a protection mechanism around the "truth", that is "understood" by all parties, in part because "high" is realized in executing those strategies, not in completing the search
