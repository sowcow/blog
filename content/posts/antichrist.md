Adult movie. I assume people with heart conditions don't watch horror, especially this one. Watching this should be an insurance violation.

Overall it's transparent but some aspects are left for delayed appreciation.
These are the animals and the physicality.
Yet solving such things calls for rewatching it and while the movie is alike to desecration, rewatching it is also in its own way.
And I think I got the general point.
