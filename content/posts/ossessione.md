Watched Obsession by Visconti.
I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.

Spoilers ahead of course.
I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.

### Lightning

I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity.
You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).

There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don't remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues.

### Mind-dump

I thought that the beginning is a bit "raw" and is not the aesthetics I expected from Visconti.
I even caught myself thinking that Visconti wanted to make something for working class.

At the end of the part (before the murder) things get more cheerful.

And I think there is not only age difference but class difference that is being highlighted.

(I forgot names since I write this way later...)
(Also I want to sleep and this makes this to be very odd piece of text)

Males are more than blind in the beginning and alot of clues about females intentions are obvious.
So director is being direct with the viewer about what is going on.

Basically there are two males.
One is very down to earth owner of own place and business.
Another is traveling and not being bound by anythnig.

There are two notable females in the movie.
The main one is like a spider who uses both males to the fullest.
Another is a very interesting occurance is probably the option
more fitting to the "traveller" but he already covered by net at that point.
Not only by the "spider" but also by cops.

Closer to the end there is an interesting twist where
a future child is supposed to redeem the murderer-couple.
But the fate crushes them in a similar way they murdered the "owner".

Also interestingly fate is being "gracious" by giving everybody except
the "traveller" some euphoria and good time before their end.

One odd small scene is where "traveller"s friend is talking to cops.
I didn't understand what that is about.

(I hope this reads not as bad as I think)
