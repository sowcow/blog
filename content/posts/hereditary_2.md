Here when it gets closer to winter small birds come around and periodically knock into windows.
They can even destroy mosquito nets if humans refuse to feed them.
As I recall farmers started feeding the population so they clean the trees but now part of the contract between the species is that humans feed them during the winter.
So while meeting the obligation and observing birds I got some ideas and decided to rewatch Hereditary.

Of course the movie is not only about birds.
On the first watch I thought it was a bit on the off-balance show-off side because it seemed too serious, even though not unconceptual.
This second watch was a bit cynical and I consider the movie to be even more conceptual and with humor too.

Anyway, the point of writing the post is so that I can think about images in the movie.
The post has served the function, but spoiling any thinking process would devalue the movie and is not sought here.
