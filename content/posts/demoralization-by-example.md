There are different meanings of demoralization that I'm aware of:
- Bezmenov meant total war by exporting ideologies that wipe-out moral reference-points and
  cause fracturing and internal conflict.
- Arestovich was talking about waves-like dynamics, I assume due to bio-chemistry
  that is more cyclical and maybe caused by strong stimuli in the first place
  (interestingly I got some of that observed by myself)

There should be more for sure but I like the interesting ones and I got this idea that
some signal demoralization (non-consuciously like most of things surely)
as some kind of warfare against mirror-neurones of others.

And there are many examples of this that I observed recently (Thase that look intentional are being produced by corporate entities).
