# First

If traumatic comedy is a genre then this picture is in it.
The combination is quite potent and this movie runs with it in both very natural and artistically developed setting.

In part the movie is like a trip, but only to the needed extent.
So it is focused and not vague.
After the trip, one gets to wind down, and the picture touches some strings too.

Talking about the setting, I got to think about ritual and sacrafice.
These things have changed their form, where they are not lost.
The picture reminds about the raw and original form and value of these behaviors.

# Second

Bonus materials of the movie are comments that public produced on it.
