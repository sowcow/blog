Since I'm exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.

I bet there are good scientific theories but I'm too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:
- social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them
- hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats
- maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not
