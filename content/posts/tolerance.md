From a perspective of a random non-educated
yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem
too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.

I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance
that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it's power.

I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions
even if they are loading them.
And thus in form they continue to exist like circles on the water even when the original meaning is lost from the public discourse.
