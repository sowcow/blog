I haven't read anything on this.
So this is just toying around for the sake of seeing where it leads.

# General

I assume thinking requires certain context being fixed.
So by affecting this context they affect following thinking.

# Scales of Stories/Thinking

1. high-level: geographical: alliances, resources
1. middle level: normal human thinking in the more understandeable/predictable world
1. mechanical scale: short-term or magical thinking in unpredictable conditions

# Dehumanization

My guess is that propaganda institutions pollute the middle level
and provide conditions for thinking in other levels.

# How Media Must be Operating on Levels

1. Statues on the TV performing rituals, high conceptions, limited access
1. Noise/nonsense, abuse of instincts of subjects
1. Fear/unpredictability spreading from the media

(I bet this is only one of ways to think about that)

(Also there may be different ways of dehumanization, for example
I believe it is dehumanization when subjects thinking attempts are interrupted
by nonsense and sofistry, but that is less relevant now even if pouplar too)

(And maybe there is actual warfare between different such systems)

# The Real World

Given these different levels it is impossibe to have a single "true story".

It is possible to have "good-enough evidence that supports/dismisses stories about facts".

So there are competing stories and competing facts.

But also there is the idea about class-warfare and ideology/language
serving that.

So there are competing stories, competing facts and cometing teams on top of that pile.

So politics/media are bound to be a mess if unconstained in their ways.

# On What This Reflects

There was a long trip with a taxist with who it
looked like I had an agreement at the time.
But somehow he without really doing anything special but with a couple of random phrases
convinced me that there is more stuff that is going-on.

Previously I gotten to like some more humane direction (that is not cheap or manipulative).
But then some exposure to some other stories moved me away from simple stories.
So things are a mess.

I definetly need to use some tools of thinking here.
