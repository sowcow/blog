I've been watching some Hitchcock and I had to have a post about this movie.
In my limited experience, I don't see the director messing with the viewer and instead it's very classy cinema.
The problem is that there is nothing to add in terms of arbitrary writing.

The movie is cold and smart, but after M proper I've enjoyed To Catch a Thief more.
Also a movie set in France must be superior a priori.
So I must forget the title and write something about To Catch a Thief instead.

No, I don't care for both of them, in a good way.
