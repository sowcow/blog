I've consciously watched Apocalypse Now three times.
First was the movie, then the documentary at some point, then later the movie with the director's commentary audio track.
These are three different lenses on the same project.

In the commentary track the director mentions that the journalist character was also inspired by a Russian from the source book.
I've thought it's funny that I'm also Russian and I tend to peddle gateway drugs into arts/cinema.
So I need to try to avoid it looking the same way.

Anyway at the risk of sounding the same way.
I have with me this nice tangent that may be related to the movie in some way:
