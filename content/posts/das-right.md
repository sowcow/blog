The word "rights" is the most prominent example of language abuse for politics sake.

1. It is short and not some yet another pseudo scientific "-ism", "-fobia". So it looks more natural on the outset;
1. It has "right" in it :)
1. You can create new "rights" every day by adding different perfixes;
1. You can use it to extract something from somebody;
1. Since it is vague term it can have broad uses especially when it comes to general public;
1. It also informs users on how to act/behave when demanding something from others: righteously;
