Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial.
Ignore fools that say it is accidental.
They just try to say that it is not positive using other peoples language.

The director is a master of visual language.
This is why the movie is rewatcheable and rich.

I'll just mention one scene.

The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows.
After that you see details that are necessary but I'll skip them to not elaborate further.

Could exclamation mark mean The Hanged Man tarot card?
Let's check Wikipedia and it quotes the 1910 book by A. E. Waitie: 

> (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. [...] I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.

Mariken in the beginning of the movie contemplates questions of life and not death while she lay among dead.

This is just one snapshot telling about boldness and quality of the director's work.
