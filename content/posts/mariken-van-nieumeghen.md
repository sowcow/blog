Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial.
May be too dark at times and thus not for all audiences and occasions.

The director is a master of visual language.
This is why the movie is rewatcheable and rich.

I'll just mention one scene.

The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows.
After that you see details that are necessary but I'll skip them to not elaborate further.

Could exclamation mark mean The Hanged Man tarot card?
Let's check Wikipedia and it quotes the 1910 book by A. E. Waitie: 

> (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. [...] I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.

Mariken in the beginning of the movie contemplates questions of life and not death while she lay among dead.

But if one reads closer to the text then most likely the following scene is just highlighted 
as one having a puzzle, pattern and certain symbolic representation irregardless of cards.
I like how in visual text one puts exclamination before.

This is just one very partial snapshot demonstrating boldness and quality of the director's work.
