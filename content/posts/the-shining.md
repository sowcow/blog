# Mist

I don't recall my first experience of the movie.
So there is this interesting state when you got some cinema literacy and
may have the illusion that you can't see it with fresh eyes.

Maybe the whole remote Hotel theme invokes that feeling that there
are experiences remote in the past that you can't even recall, not to say about making sense of.

# Got scared off

I watched the movie in a headset.
I generally control fear response by having controlled volume and being analytical.

So I was watching it in the evening.
Then somewhere after the scene of discussing "outside inference" with Grady.
I hear abrupt mix of screaming/singing by a somewhat crazy neighbor that does these at some days.
So I just had a break watching the movie that day.

# Grandeur

Actually, scary movies are not my genre of interest.
I want movie to be analytical and stimulating.

This one, even though I did not recognize it during the first watch these days, very much fits the bill.
Even more, it must be my favorite among Kubrick's movies now.

Even though all three movies are very ambitious and are plenty of fun,
this movie slaughters Space Odyssey in terms of action and possibilities.
Eyes Wide Shut degenerate splendor is challenged by certain fundamental gravity and categorical relevance.
I say these two movies can be seen as contrasting.

I do not consider this movie to be simply a scary movie.
And I may want to check if some other good instances exist in that genre.

# Interpretation

I've heard something about Indigenous American references to be relevant for interpretation.
Hair-splitting about such details is not useful in interpreting the movie.
They have some suggestion power, but they are far from the subject and are not necessary for understanding it.

I didn't read the original novel.
But some fundamental literary images are interwoven into the movie's fabric.
