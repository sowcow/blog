The certain dramatic beauty of nature makes me really think about whether dramatic suffering fits the place.
Kichijiro is an interesting and ambiguous character.
Clinging to one’s own religion in an environment hostile to it may be interpreted very differently.

Also I remember Scorsese mentioning how changing the end of the movie has changed the whole film.
I think when unexpected meanings emerge, that’s the juicy aspect for the artist.
And I’m content with exactly that.
