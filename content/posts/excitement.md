Another interesting insight from reading GTD
is that there is a level of positive feelings you
get from envisioning future results of your projects.

The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process.
So the need to have "artificial sweeteners" goes down.

I think that excitement is the only reasonable
expectation from your projects with this system.
