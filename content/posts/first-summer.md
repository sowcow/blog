I found that I pay attention to the good quality views around me more.
Summer of course.

There is another thing possibly due to how my memory works.
It looks like it is the first time I pay this much attention.

And I think this is the case in many cases.

Like horison line with trees looks so much better.
Even colors of leafs and sky there.

Overall blossoming of course is so plentiful.
And color gradations on different trees tells you something about them.

I assume me starting to pay attention to arts and getting to know things makes me pay more attention this year.
I see that is not the first time me enjoying nature but this time it is more detailed.

Another theory is that I started to "care-less" about non-important stuff.
It is like when Larry David in his series found-out that he may be not jewish but white christian so he starts being less concerned and more easy.
I think same thing may be here in a way and that frees some attention resources.
