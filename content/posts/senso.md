Beatiful views of Venice and Italy and other aesthetics of course.
Both strong feelings and something different also.

My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :).
The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different.
So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!

There is a class difference that I see in different movies.
Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.

Then first Franz acheives certain success that never was his.
Starts being "just himself" and gets ruined by lack of his illusion that he saw in mirrors.

Then he breaks Livia's illusion about that relationship.

At the culmination Livia is:
- put down as a female
- shown to be a traitor of closest people
- shown to be like him? (non-aristocratic, shallow person) while spending all aristocratic capital (that was never her?)

So she becomes indirectly a murderer also.

Big cost of:
- lofty illusions that mismatch the reality
- blindness to others and own nature (shallow/deep and male/female brains)
- (age and) class mismatch in relationships
