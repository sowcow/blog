Beautiful aesthetics.
Not to say about views of Venice and Italy.
Both strong feelings and something different also.

My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :).
The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different.
So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!

There is a class difference that I see in different movies.
Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.

Then first Franz acheives certain success that never was his.
Starts being "just himself" and gets ruined by lack of his illusion that he saw in mirrors.

Then he breaks Livia's illusion about that relationship.

At the culmination Livia is:
- put down as a female
- shown to be a traitor of closest people
- shown to be like him? (non-aristocratic, shallow person) while spending all aristocratic capital (that was never her?)

So she becomes indirectly a murderer also.

Big cost of:
- lofty illusions that mismatch the reality
- blindness to others and own nature (shallow/deep and male/female brains and confusing successfull crooks for nobility)
- (age and) class mismatch in relationships

Of course the husband being a complete fool also contributed.

- Also age difference.
- Not paying attention and not being able to control the wife.
- Not recognizing a "threat"

I guess the husband and very cooperative handmaid are comedic players there.

Human passions are compared to warfare it seems.
Interestingly that Livia enters the war scene to help Roberto.
But she gets conquered herself.
In this war some people died on a hill.
Some got ruined in passions and broken illusions.

Broken mirror I think summarizes events in the movie.
