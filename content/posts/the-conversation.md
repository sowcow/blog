The movie has a sad subject, but it does not try to pull a tear from the viewer’s eye.
In fact, it features a mime and some funny scenes, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually a comedy.
It also features visuals of interest and a range of ambiguity, so I'm inclined to rewatch it, even though the movie doesn't force that per se.
