Usually I'm not big into reading and reading newspapers.
But a couple days ago I stumbled upon one article.
Actually the article won the competition among other headers first.
Then I just got to like the rich tools used in the content.
Basically the article got me captured starting from the header.

And this is unusual for me.
So I checked the author.
She has only one another article there.
But there are many other books and articles in foreign media too.
