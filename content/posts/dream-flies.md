So I got a random dream some days ago.
In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn't do for a number of years).
Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.

I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner.
