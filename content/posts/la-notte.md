Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say...
I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas...

I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.

Pros:
- Some nice shots are present
- Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there

Cons:
- pace is not for me
- messy so called "psychological" stuff about characters
  being unhappy and all that does not attract me

Notables:
- very obvious contrast of old person looking into a cup vs young people looking into skies but no idea where to attach that
- the male character is so out of place, no idea what to think about that

So I'll switch back to Zefirelli for something more lively.
