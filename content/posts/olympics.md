In Russian to cheer for the team can be directly translated into english as "to be ill for".

I found it amusing when a reporter from Olympics in China said that "We are still being ill here".

Also between that it is very patriotic to show
some soviet technological developments/acheivements that were not pursued after the fall.
So that people feel the dark sorrow for the glorious past
and resentment toward ideological enemies.

Anyway it would be cool to finaly have robots
competing in their own Olympics but somehow we don't see that.

I lean towards the side that
robots are so worthless that such olympics
would be laughable.

But also even if you have non-useless robots
then the next weak link is people and
they would make them a parody anyway.

Least bad scenario would be robots running in masks.
And of course you can make them swim in coca-cola or in ketchup.
