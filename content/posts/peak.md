I've read Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise.
Hopefully it's not the first book I finished this year.
Anyway it's positive and balanced and must be the common knowledge now.

Before that I started giving good attempts at The Cambrdige Grammar.
The stuff is dense, good, and challenging.

I guess The Cambridge book can be seen as reading to failure while Peak is a rest day support.
Normally I'd see anything not filled with lists as watered-down but Peak is a good hydration.

Of course, actual peak for me would be to deal with the grammar book while the Peak book teaches the steadiness and mechanics to employ.
