In the old times hunters used to skin animals and sell the result.

These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor.
But the skin gets even more expensive!

And with all the abundant money supply these days also.
I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.

Wild times they are!
