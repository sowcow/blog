      <description>So I got a random dream some days ago. In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn&amp;rsquo;t do for a number of years). Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.
I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner.</description>

      <description>I heave read about some strange practices that some marginal groups or individuals praticed. So there was something like trying to force oneself into seeing non-existing things and not seeing things that are there.
It looks like these days there are adpets at every corner. And they have acheived highest levels of trance.
I assume levels of subversion with the advent of mass media are so high. That they don&amp;rsquo;t need to pratice anything to get that state.</description>

      <description>So I decided to put some thoughts about my coding here. There are three of them.
Copy-pasting This is one of my time wasters. I have this expectation that copy-pasted block should just work. But then there are little details that I miss that require a debugging session later.
Copy pasting by itself is not that evil. It can be avoided by additional abstractions. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit to any random abstraction either.</description>

      <description>Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself. I thought that there has to be a reason for that. And indeed I found couple of them.
Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it&amp;rsquo;s source.
And then I thought about artificial sources.
Given say body positivity. When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves. This is ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Random Dentist Experience</title>

      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>
