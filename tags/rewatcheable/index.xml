      <description>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that &amp;ldquo;surrounding&amp;rdquo; Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.</description>

      <description>I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.
Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.
I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.
Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
 NOTE: some spoilers ahead
 The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is.</description>
