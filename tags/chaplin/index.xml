      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-context&#34;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems.&#xA;Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out.&#xA;So the opportunity to do that was realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon.&#xA;And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop.&#xA;So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;city-lights&#34;&gt;City Lights&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting.&#xA;And compared to the earliest short silent comedy that I have had an opportunity to check.&#xA;This definetly looks like more serios work.&#xA;Surely you get what is expected - extremely comical scenes.&#xA;And you get more variability because of length.&#xA;But you also get the main plot that makes it a real movie.&#xA;And there is something more I believe.&#xA;Maybe it is that you can alter the speed of the show&#xA;when you are not constrained by the short format.&#xA;And Charlie uses that option to have scenes of different pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
