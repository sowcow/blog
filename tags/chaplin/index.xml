      <description>Some Context Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems. Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out. So the opportunity to do that was realized.
Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon. And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop. So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.
City Lights Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.
Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting.</description>
