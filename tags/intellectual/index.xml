      <description>During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings. They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.
In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein. I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.
First is obviously similar short form.
Second is political angle. As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time.</description>
