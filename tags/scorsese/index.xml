      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there was general context of hearing how this was one of the movies notably influenced by Powell and Pressburger cinema.&#xA;The movie&amp;rsquo;s title sequence by itself confirms that art-cinema aspect being there.&#xA;And actually it confirms the reference, if one wants to see it from that angle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching it from that perspective was not obviously satisactory entertainment, but it actually gave me some enjoyable parallels.&#xA;And it gave some of own picture&amp;rsquo;s language that could be missed without that kind of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As any good film this documentary addresses different audiences&amp;rsquo; interests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be seen as an overview and an introduction to the cinema of Powel and Pressburger also branded The Archers.&#xA;I like how creative paths of that collaboration and M. Scorsese are interwoven in different ways.&#xA;So, it can be seen as double documentary to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this is not a documentary in any dull sense because the subject cinema is so creative, expressive and as strong or as subtle as one allows it to be.&#xA;In 2023 BFI called the event celebrating the artists &amp;ldquo;Cinema Unbound&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a breaking of the fourth wall element in theater/cinema.&#xA;I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools.&#xA;For example, in Killer&amp;rsquo;s of the Flower Moon, there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth wall&#xA;and one obvious one at the end.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d say, even if sneaky, they signify key moments to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For whatever questionable reason, I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently.&#xA;Somehow, the director, even if the he has great work, tends to be mentioned by Russian speaking people who signal sophistication.&#xA;And I&amp;rsquo;m fine if somebody references, at least after watching it, if the reference is good.&#xA;But in that case, the referencer probably asked chat-gpt and got hallucinated and confused mix of stuff.&#xA;So it was the worst possible reference, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to think about that.&#xA;(BTW: I use chat-gpt to put commas around; hopefully, that does not make my references bad).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before&#34;&gt;Before&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What got my attention to the movie is unexpected change on one channel.&#xA;The channel had comments turned off and occasionally different art was posted there.&#xA;Then there appeared somewhat simplistic yet dissonant review of the movie and comments went turned on.&#xA;I knew that M. Scorsese looks into ethnical differences and criminal characters and groups.&#xA;I think I guessed right at the time what moved the channel&amp;rsquo;s author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Talking about the first segment here.&#xA;Awesome and controversial piece.&#xA;Watching this only one time is not getting the value.&#xA;And general context of watching should be different too so I&amp;#39;d recommend arbitrary time gap between sessions.&#xA;Also spoilers here may spoil the second watch too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;The first segment of New York Stories is by Martin Scorsese.&#xA;I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Blues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese.&#xA;I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea.&#xA;I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle.&#xA;Most of the time music itself did not attract me.&#xA;And that got me interested even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
