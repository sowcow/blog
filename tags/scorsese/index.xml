      <description>Talking about the first segment here. Awesome and controversial piece. Watching this only one time is not getting the value. And general context of watching should be different too so I&amp;#39;d recommend arbitrary time gap between sessions. Also spoilers here may spoil the second watch too.
The first segment of New York Stories is by Martin Scorsese. I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still.</description>

      <description>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.</description>
