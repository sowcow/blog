      <description>Disclaimer I&amp;rsquo;m totally amateur in all this stuff so this &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.
Music Music was one of liberal arts education subjects. I strongly feel that it is for a reason.
On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it offers certain hope and positive expectations.
On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.</description>
