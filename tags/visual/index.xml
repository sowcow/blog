      <description>During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings. They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.
In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein. I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.
First is obviously similar short form.
Second is political angle. As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time.</description>

      <description>Back in a day I liked heroes of might and magic game. Overall it was not right to get me addicted but I really liked some parts.
One thing I found odd is that there are like ten types of dragons. Most of them I considered to be nonsensical - created just to fill some gaps in ideas.
One particular kind of dragons I liked irrationally is the Skeleton Dragon that can be upgraded to the Ghost Dragon.</description>

      <description>I stumbled upon this one even though it was not one on the recommendations list. I just got to like it and finished. Touches different aspects without staying there for too long. Has nice quotes and seduces you with colorful images. Seems nice for beginners.</description>

      <description>There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days. It can be summarized this way: I didn&amp;rsquo;t beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter. And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that. But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.
Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view.</description>
