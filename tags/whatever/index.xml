      <description>Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli. Not in one session on one hand. But on the other hand the second session was something different and very fresh for me.
Alot of times the picture just looks well. I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.
In school I didn&amp;rsquo;t read stuff. They forced stuff on us and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that.</description>
