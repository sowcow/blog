      <description>There are different meanings of demoralization that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of:
 Bezmenov meant total war by exporting ideologies that wipe-out moral reference-points and cause fracturing and internal conflict. Arestovich was talking about waves-like dynamics, I assume due to bio-chemistry that is more cyclical and maybe caused by strong stimuli in the first place (interestingly I got some of that observed by myself)  There should be more for sure but I like the interesting ones and I got this idea that some signal demoralization (non-consuciously like most of things surely) as some kind of warfare against mirror-neurones of others.</description>

      <description>Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli. Not in one session on one hand. But on the other hand the second session was something different and very fresh for me.
Alot of times the picture just looks well. I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.
In school I didn&amp;rsquo;t read stuff. They forced stuff on us and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that.</description>
