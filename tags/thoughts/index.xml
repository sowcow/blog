      <description>So I decided to put some thoughts about my coding here. There are three of them.
Copy-pasting This is one of my time wasters. I have this expectation that copy-pasted block should just work. But then there are little details that I miss that require a debugging session later.
Copy pasting by itself is not that evil. It can be avoided by additional abstractions. But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit to any random abstraction either.</description>

      <description>Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself. I thought that there has to be a reason for that. And indeed I found couple of them.
Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it&amp;rsquo;s source.
And then I thought about artificial sources.
Given say body positivity. When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves. This is ambiguous.</description>
