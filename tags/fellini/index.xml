      <description>Rich movie, unforgettable images Lots of echoes inside Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time. Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.
Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie.</description>

      <description>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with.</description>
