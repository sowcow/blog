      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rich movie, unforgettable images&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lots of echoes inside&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time.&#xA;Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie.&#xA;The more patched nature of the movie may relax constrains on interpretation of scenes to some extent.&#xA;The movie even has abstract poetry read at some point, what highlights and invites ambiguity.&#xA;Level of details and different themes touched makes for a rich mix and questions posed of different level of visibility anchor viewer to pay attention.&#xA;Echoes in the movie helps you compose the picture in non-linear way for even richer composition to go beyond superficial limits of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You see quality from the start.&#xA;A movie about life and play that says it for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them.&#xA;So there is a rewatch value added just by that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already.&#xA;But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with. Only if it is timed well after other high quality content to compare to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
