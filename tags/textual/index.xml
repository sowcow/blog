      <description>Then I try to install a habit for reading from time to time. Previous attempt was Faust that weights 2 kilos because of big format and stylistically different but exceptional pictures on every other page. Such pictures were competing with images in the text but I enjoyed both. One notable experience such book can give is when you are trying to analyze through some text and turn the page and see some unexpected picture.</description>

      <description>During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings. They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.&#xA;In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein. I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.&#xA;First is obviously similar short form.&#xA;Second is political angle. As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time.</description>
