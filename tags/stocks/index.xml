      <description>So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.
First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks. And I holded them. Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.
Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold. And missed some good actual run from that point.</description>

      <description>Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock. Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.
Some theories on what happened:
 Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash stock offering profit fixation on the main session  It was interesting time in russian virgin-sect random trading circles. Fun quote: &amp;ldquo;So 20% up by the night is a side movement for you?&amp;rdquo;</description>
