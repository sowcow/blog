      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;path&#34;&gt;Path&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.&#xA;It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.&#xA;It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.&#xA;Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.&#xA;Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.&#xA;Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.&#xA;Both in verses and the video on top of them.&#xA;This time the experience was without the &amp;ldquo;noise in torn-out ears without head&amp;rdquo; in the process&#xA;and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.&#xA;Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
