      <description>Context There is a breaking of the forth wall element in theater/cinema. I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools. For example in Killer&amp;rsquo;s of the Flower Moon there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth walls and one obvious in the end. I&amp;rsquo;d say even if sneaky they signify key moments to consider.&#xA;For whatever questionable reason I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently.</description>

      <description>Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there. After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.&#xA;On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights. And this sets the standard and expectation. So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used. But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact.</description>

      <description>I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).&#xA;There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not. It is very satisfying to see the director&amp;rsquo;s play and then he confirms it too.&#xA;That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested. It is a funny scene on the first look.&#xA;Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes.</description>

      <description>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.&#xA;The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.&#xA;Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.</description>
