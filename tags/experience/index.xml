      <title>Three Names</title>

      <description>Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time. Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website. The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.&#xA;one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that next is the English version of the name; but I&amp;rsquo;m not from England or the US Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially. But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day. In fact I&amp;rsquo;ll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.&#xA;So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to.</description>

      <description>It is in a way like in that movie: Inception. There are forgotten situations that has power over you. And there are symbols that you get to have around instead. At some point you decode the symbols back.&#xA;It feels energetic but calming. It is too rare an experience to not record it.</description>

      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.&#xA;And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anesthesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.&#xA;And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>
