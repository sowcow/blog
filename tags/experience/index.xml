      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anestesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>
