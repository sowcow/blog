      <description>Context I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything. And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.
Thoughts It was always visually interesting experience for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect black and white movies being such rich medium. Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.
I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it.</description>
