      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially. But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day. I&amp;rsquo;ll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.
So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to.</description>

      <description>This time So I was about to visit a dentist today. It was my last visit in this &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo;. And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.
And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anesthesia it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.
And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.</description>
