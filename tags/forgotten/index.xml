      <description>It is in a way like in that movie: Inception. There are forgotten situations that has power over you. And there are symbols that you get to have around instead. At some point you decode the symbols back.&#xA;It feels energetic but calming. It is too rare an experience to not record it.</description>

      <description>Background facts I have not practiced consistently. And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.&#xA;Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know meditation again. With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly. Also the alternative &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; is available. This is something new for me.</description>
