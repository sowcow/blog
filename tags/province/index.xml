      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly the next day after watching After Hours, I visited a free painting gallery in a small city and got some impressions on another side of the moon from that movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed was patched carpet on the floor &amp;ndash; not exactly The Shining style but still a notable detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The corridor led me into the first small room.&#xA;While I was checking pictures there alone, a guy passed nearby.&#xA;He was moving as if holding and looking into an invisible mobile phone in his hand; he greeted me and made an odd meaningless pause near me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
