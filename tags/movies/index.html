  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This is not the first time I see this. But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used. It makes things more understandable and more like communication.
So I liked how director emphasises certain places. That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience. Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.
Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed....</p>

   <p>Spoilers Land
The movie has multiple parts. I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in. And then to write more gave another look. And then I could not resisit another look…
The setting is in the Alps. Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls. Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points… Red color is favored there....</p>

    <h2>Il Giovane Toscanini</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way. I’m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.
The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.
 First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued; Second when he revives the diva; Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking; And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;  I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it’s place....</p>

   <p>I watched alot of stuff in 2021 that I’d like to write something about just to see how it goes. But there should be a starting point somewhere and the most recent movie is the subject of the post.
The movie is short so the post should follow the shape of the movie.
What I have seen is lots of patches with with some light humour everywhere in between. Patches are different and that may be confusing because it looks like there are serious topics interwoven....</p>

    <h2>The Blues</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
 The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves....</p>

    <h2>Otto E Mezzo</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with....</p>

    <h2>Pagliacci</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.
Visually and overall I’m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don’t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new....</p>

    <h2>Cavalleria Rusticana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn’t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I’m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can’t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I’m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well....</p>

    <h2>Meet Joe Black</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see the good quality there. There is class I believe too.
One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I’m used to capture but it is definetly visible.
The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.
Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish. At some points you may think: “What kind of dialogs are these?...</p>

    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>
