    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg. I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.
First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it. Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can’t unsee it. This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be. Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them....</p>

    <h2>Conversation Piece</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the piece again and saw some of it’s riches.
The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called “unveiling”. Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell’Orsa right there. But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.
Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.
Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don’t know why yet....</p>

    <h2>Loading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>After getting excited by New York Stories. I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.
I say it can’t be other way. Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind. So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors....</p>

  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Talking about the first segment here. Awesome and controversial piece. Watching this only one time is not getting the value. And general context of watching should be different too so I&#39;d recommend arbitrary time gap between sessions. Also spoilers here may spoil the second watch too.
 The first segment of New York Stories is by Martin Scorsese. I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>On the outside it is a music box that is visually tasty and theatrical. When you open it you are there for multitude of melodies of crying among other serious and humorous lines.
This may make an impression of some femininity aspect or certain serious non-seriousness, naivete and oversimplification/cliche-even or even offensive to somebody’s perception of normal and mirror-neurons abuse.
Offended crowd is not the one worth listening to but still perception of such toys may need the right mindset that they don’t possess....</p>

    <h2>Genre Change</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Path Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change. It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece. It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.
Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev. Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology. Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.
I’ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I’ll skip them to not elaborate further....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I ended-up watching some movies recently. One of them ended-up being Memento. Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.
Idea The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place. This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.
Movie The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order....</p>
