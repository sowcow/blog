    <h2>Unmasking the Face</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context There is a breaking of the forth wall element in theater/cinema. I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools. For example in Killer’s of the Flower Moon there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth walls and one obvious in the end. I’d say even if sneaky they signify key moments to consider.
For whatever questionable reason I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently....</p>

    <h2>Killers of the Flower Moon</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Before What got my attention to the movie is unexpected change on one channel. The channel had comments turned off and occasionally different art was posted there. Then there appeared somewhat simplistic yet dissonant review of the movie and comments went turned on. I knew that M. Scorsese looks into ethnical differences and criminal characters and groups. I think I guessed right at the time what moved the channel’s author....</p>

    <h2>Matter of Life and Death</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.
Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.
Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and “flight from Berlin”. Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.
There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored....</p>

    <h2>Black Narcissus</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>It is a type of lucid Disney movie crossing into a horror film. The earliest erotic movie. Melodrama about nuns.
Spoilers may lie ahead.
Team In director’s commentary M. Powell mentions:
high quality of the team and art department cases of intrinsic match of actors to roles directors role of believing in the project how the team kind of lived through the movie (without big picture possibly?) And this final point probably assumes a degree of improvisation on actors part in the process and also a degree of freedom during the editing part....</p>

    <h2>Eyes Wide Shut</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context Even though I’ve seen some of this director and I recall some things to be interesting I otherwise avoided watching his work because the name seemed too popular. Checked this one for a random reason. I wasn’t sure about the choice for the first half maybe. But then the director delivered technically. And then I got to see the conception that is brilliant too.
Summary Delivered in colorful and crinkling packaging to distract the viewer; simultaneously Christmas and Halloween joke played right on the viewer; yet also having a personal down to earth snapshot of not obvious family business management at one point....</p>

    <h2>Der Himmel über Berlin</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there. After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.
On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights. And this sets the standard and expectation. So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used. But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact....</p>

    <h2>La Dolce Vita</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Rich movie, unforgettable images Lots of echoes inside Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time. Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.
Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie....</p>

    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg. I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.
First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it. Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can’t unsee it. This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be. Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them....</p>

    <h2>Conversation Piece</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the piece again and saw some of it’s riches.
The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called “unveiling”. Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell’Orsa right there. But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.
Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.
Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don’t know why yet....</p>

    <h2>Loading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>After getting excited by New York Stories. I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.
I say it can’t be other way. Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind. So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors....</p>
