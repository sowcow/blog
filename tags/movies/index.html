    <h2>The Blues</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
 The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves....</p>

    <h2>Otto E Mezzo</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with....</p>

    <h2>Pagliacci</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.
Visually and overall I’m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don’t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new....</p>

    <h2>Cavalleria Rusticana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn’t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I’m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can’t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I’m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well....</p>

    <h2>Meet Joe Black</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see the good quality there. There is class I believe too.
One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I’m used to capture but it is definetly visible.
The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.
Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish. At some points you may think: “What kind of dialogs are these?...</p>

    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>

    <h2>Il Conformista</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First. Visually interesting without question. I also liked characters there. Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.
The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze. And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.
There is this word “soviet intelligent-sy”. It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time....</p>

    <h2>Burn After Reading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially I thought that “extremely funny nonsense” describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.
But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive. So that it may require some tools to weave that. Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that....</p>

    <h2>Viridiana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow but it always finds a way to astonish you.
I don’t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective. I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I’m so used to like. But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation. It is just that odd and in a way immutable. This way of looking at it seems new to me....</p>

    <h2>La Charme Discret De La Bourgeoisie</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.
Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.
I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.
Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
 NOTE: some spoilers ahead
 The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is....</p>
