    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>

    <h2>Il Conformista</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First. Visually interesting without question. I also liked characters there. Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.
The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze. And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.
There is this word “soviet intelligent-sy”. It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time....</p>

    <h2>Burn After Reading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially I thought that “extremely funny nonsense” describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.
But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive. So that it may require some tools to weave that. Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that....</p>

    <h2>Viridiana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow but it always finds a way to astonish you.
I don’t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective. I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I’m so used to like. But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation. It is just that odd and in a way immutable. This way of looking at it seems new to me....</p>

    <h2>La Charme Discret De La Bourgeoisie</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.
Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.
I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.
Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.
 NOTE: some spoilers ahead
 The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is....</p>

    <h2>Callas Forever</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.
The beginning predictably left me not excited. The movie provides some words to describe it: “too modern”. And the word “flat” came to my mind too. No idea why. I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.
At the end of the first third you get to see some development and get intrigued by it....</p>

    <h2>Half Watch</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).
It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.
Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.
I think that it works this way:...</p>

    <h2>Sparrow</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well. Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing. And that I’m not the right audience for the theme overall. And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.
During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work. At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet....</p>

    <h2>La Notte</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say… I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas…
I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.
Pros:
 Some nice shots are present Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there  Cons:
 pace is not for me messy so called “psychological” stuff about characters being unhappy and all that does not attract me ugly sounds play from time to time  Notables:...</p>

    <h2>The Adventure</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.
Anyway visually I’m just too easy to impress so I liked many “shots”.
There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.
I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode…...</p>
