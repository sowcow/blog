    <h2>Les Miserables</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>On the outside it is a music box that is visually tasty and theatrical. When you open it you are there for multitude of melodies of crying among other serious and humorous lines.
This may make an impression of some femininity aspect or certain serious non-seriousness, naivete and oversimplification/cliche-even or even offensive to somebody’s perception of normal and mirror-neurons abuse.
Offended crowd is not the one worth listening to but still perception of such toys may need the right mindset that they don’t possess....</p>

    <h2>Genre Change</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Path Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change. It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece. It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.
Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev. Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology. Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings....</p>

    <h2>Mariken van Nieumeghen</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.
I’ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I’ll skip them to not elaborate further....</p>

    <h2>Memento</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I ended-up watching some movies recently. One of them ended-up being Memento. Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.
Idea The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place. This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.
Movie The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order....</p>

    <h2>Planet Parade</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Summary Good soviet movie about middle-aged males gathering for a trip. The viewer has lots of moments of reflection on deep matters of existence and life. Offering nostalgia and sharpened sense of time.
Context The movie was mentioned on Arestovich’s program twice AFAIK. So that added it to my list.
Normally after having listened to some classics it is especially hard to get me interesting in a soviet movie with military theme....</p>

    <h2>Peeping Tom</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Spoiler alert and all that.
I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago. It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.
Key points many things at once is how I see it the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious it succeeded at confusing me at points surely effect: not scared but puzzled (which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis) high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes, different personalities, direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there; fearless desensitized vs fearless normal magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably topic of desensitization by the industry enjoyed accents Quality all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling but the director did his work by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect; the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things and producing effects, “things perceptable and the general level is not distracting your from products”, so there should be rewatch value from that for sure; it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad so you have your time to think about stuff, I liked that for sure, yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material; Exceprts That “he is the director” I understood it (but not at that moment) as both:...</p>

    <h2>City Lights</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Some Context Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems. Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out. So the opportunity to do that was realized.
Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon. And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop. So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.
City Lights Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.
Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting....</p>

    <h2>L&#39;oro Di Napoli</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This is not the first time I see this. But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used. It makes things more understandable and more like communication.
So I liked how director emphasises certain places. That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience. Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.
Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed....</p>
