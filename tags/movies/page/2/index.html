    <h2>Mariken van Nieumeghen</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.
I’ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I’ll skip them to not elaborate further....</p>

    <h2>Memento</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I ended-up watching some movies recently. One of them ended-up being Memento. Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.
Idea The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place. This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.
Movie The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order....</p>

    <h2>Planet Parade</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Summary Good soviet movie about middle-aged males gathering for a trip. The viewer has lots of moments of reflection on deep matters of existence and life. Offering nostalgia and sharpened sense of time.
Context The movie was mentioned on Arestovich’s program twice AFAIK. So that added it to my list.
Normally after having listened to some classics it is especially hard to get me interesting in a soviet movie with military theme....</p>

    <h2>City Lights</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Some Context Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems. Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out. So the opportunity to do that was realized.
Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon. And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop. So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.
City Lights Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.
Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting....</p>

    <h2>L&#39;oro Di Napoli</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This is not the first time I see this. But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used. It makes things more understandable and more like communication.
So I liked how director emphasises certain places. That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience. Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.
Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed....</p>

    <h2>Le Streghe (Visconti part)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Spoilers Land
The movie has multiple parts. I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in. And then to write more gave another look. And then I could not resisit another look…
The setting is in the Alps. Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls. Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points… Red color is favored there....</p>

    <h2>Il Giovane Toscanini</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way. I’m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.
The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.
First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued; Second when he revives the diva; Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking; And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event; I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it’s place....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched alot of stuff in 2021 that I’d like to write something about just to see how it goes. But there should be a starting point somewhere and the most recent movie is the subject of the post.
The movie is short so the post should follow the shape of the movie.
What I have seen is lots of patches with with some light humour everywhere in between. Patches are different and that may be confusing because it looks like there are serious topics interwoven....</p>

    <h2>The Blues</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese. I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea. I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.
The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle. Most of the time music itself did not attract me. And that got me interested even more.
Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves....</p>

    <h2>Otto E Mezzo</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see quality from the start. A movie about life and play that says it for itself.
From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them. So there is a rewatch value added just by that.
Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already. But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with....</p>
