    <h2>The Adventure</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.
Anyway visually I’m just too easy to impress so I liked many “shots”.
There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.
I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode…...</p>

    <h2>The Eclipse</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was. First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background. Now I decided to try another one and you guess what. It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits. Then it contrasts it by some piano notes....</p>

    <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The one by Zeffirelli. Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.
The first impression is what is called “Tube sound” in Russia at least. So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case. After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive it is quality of the movie too. It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy....</p>

    <h2>Brother Sun, Sister Moon</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.
It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images. As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision. And it was compelling in some way to me.
I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too....</p>

    <h2>Gravity</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the movie. It seems more balanced than Interstellar. It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that). But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.
It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.
It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological. Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense....</p>

    <h2>Interstellar</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I’ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed....</p>

    <h2>Tea with Mussolini</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The movie is like a story with different aspects to it. It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations. But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.
One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini’s table is. Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene....</p>

    <h2>Blowup</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>My first movie of the director. I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall. I put there thoughts I got from it.
Scenes: In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist. The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start....</p>

    <h2>L Innocente</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I don’t use names here because they does not matter. It is not a movie for rewatching for me. I feel that that “dark freedom” mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive. One the other hand it still takes it’s own place. With it’s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment. But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view. No idea why.
TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders....</p>

    <h2>Senso</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Beautiful aesthetics. Not to say about views of Venice and Italy. Both strong feelings and something different also.
My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :). The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different. So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!
There is a class difference that I see in different movies. Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature....</p>
