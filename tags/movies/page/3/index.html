  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the movie. It seems more balanced than Interstellar. It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that). But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.
It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.
It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological. Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I’ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed....</p>

    <h2>Tea with Mussolini</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The movie is like a story with different aspects to it. It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations. But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.
One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini’s table is. Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene....</p>

    <h2>Blowup</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>My first movie of the director. I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall. I put there thoughts I got from it.
Scenes: In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist. The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start....</p>

    <h2>L Innocente</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I don’t use names here because they does not matter. It is not a movie for rewatching for me. I feel that that “dark freedom” mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive. One the other hand it still takes it’s own place. With it’s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment. But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view. No idea why.
TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders....</p>

    <h2>Senso</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Beautiful aesthetics. Not to say about views of Venice and Italy. Both strong feelings and something different also.
My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :). The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different. So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!
There is a class difference that I see in different movies. Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature....</p>

    <h2>Lo Straniero / The Stranger</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well. But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching. Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.
 Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn’t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie....</p>
