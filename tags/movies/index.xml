      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crude animations seem to be more analyzable than full-range of expression movies.&#xA;There must be a line between overanalyzing, getting tangled in dumbland, and underanalyzing, being dumblander by the virtue of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Godfather</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched the first two parts of the trilogy, and the beginning of the third felt a bit too light for me.&#xA;Then the third also gets more understandable for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part seems to be my favorite due to its humor and conceptual elements.&#xA;The second is remembered for horror elements and overall the form of parallel if not comparative narrative.&#xA;The third part plays with false memory, feels less detached, and explores grander theme of Godfather coming to believe in God.&#xA;Maybe it even grounds the image of orange as a symbol of original sin, but sin for power instead of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not always intuitive how to untangle the movie from the character.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a colorful movie for sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a brilliant movie and it covers some range.&#xA;There are even lost maidens in the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I bet people who don&amp;rsquo;t like the movie watch it drunk.&#xA;But then they probably take smoke breaks also, so it should be still manageable trip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Coppola really looks like somebody I would want to study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;impression&#34;&gt;Impression&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought I might get Persona but got Space Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is this most sober female perspective on one hand, on the other hand I&amp;rsquo;d expect horror elements to contradict soberness.&#xA;I guess the odd border between horror and dark comedy and the position of the viewer on it is what defines genre of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;ending-interpretation-spoilers&#34;&gt;Ending interpretation (spoilers)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shock of the ending is that the rapist ends up being more moral/better than her.&#xA;Because he acts in accordance with laws of nature, even if against laws of men, but she, however involuntarily, defies both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t choose what I like more in this cinema.&#xA;I can enjoy both it&amp;rsquo;s ambiguity and balance/sanity of how it is made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a classy and original take on the same subject as Hereditary.&#xA;Hereditary does on it some funny references I&amp;rsquo;d say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good cinema medium is so dense and these coincidences of watching so related movies on consecutive days really makes it feel magical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;impression&#34;&gt;Impression&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has another level gaslighting with catchlights.&#xA;Also birch trees are my favorite.&#xA;Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s hypnotic yet plain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Midsommar, this one is not funny.&#xA;Yet there is still the sacrifice aspect, but the negative perspective.&#xA;I assume it&amp;rsquo;s The Wicker Man one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;rsquo;s also alignable to the unnamed here movie.&#xA;One interesting difference I noticed on the current/first watch is that there is a lack of a defined sense of smell.&#xA;This invisible lead can be connected to different things, but generally speaking I&amp;rsquo;d say Midsommar answers that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedy has some ingredient in it that makes characters more alive somehow, so it&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable mix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall it&amp;rsquo;s great.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit controversial to cut the ending like that,&#xA;but it means all the fun of a more complete ending is left to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked the initial part.&#xA;Not much humour later on but I think the movie hits multiple targets this way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically the same but trying to be more mature in its madness.&#xA;The whole Final Destination franchise must be based on this series or another common source.&#xA;Personally, I prefer more foolish previous movies but they all must have at least a scene or detail that gets remembered.&#xA;I really like the foolishness ingredient, but also I like it to be surprising so I&amp;rsquo;m not certain on caricature horror movies yet.&#xA;On the other hand going dramatic raises the comparison bar, so you need to have it at the right degree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It features trashy yet not overly explicit humour here and there.&#xA;Maybe this combination made it more immersive for me.&#xA;Digging it for meaning would be such an offense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watch somewhat technically, considering references in the process and freely having breaks for whatever reason.&#xA;This movie is considerably dark and it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I thought that by having breaks I might reduce the experience/immersion aspect.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how I noticed this cheating only when I decided to switch the genre anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I may be getting somewhat gaslit by the genre with its demand for attention and guessing.&#xA;Yet I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to switch it now since it is such an insightful genre.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll have to balance the imaginative part by maybe more perceptive volume.&#xA;Exact borders between activities too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happiness is better than art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the classiest things in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somehow I wanted/expected this movie to be the origin of the catchlight effect, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you wait for it.&#xA;In the arts or technology it&amp;rsquo;s not straightforward to make claims about origins, so it is more about personal experience.&#xA;In my experience, Dracula (1931) features the idea in a single stark shot.&#xA;Then this movie develops the idea and has that artistical consistency, so it seems to put the idea at the core of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://sowcow.github.io/blog/posts/dracula_1958/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This movie goes more explicitly about visuals and action.&#xA;I assume the introduction of color seduced the creator to seek ways that are more direct to the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see overlap of tools that The Shining also uses but here in a more implicit form.&#xA;Not to say that The Shining is being explicit, or less ambiguous, it&amp;rsquo;s just a different kind of ambiguity.&#xA;In older movies it seems just a hint was considered enough so as not to burden the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classy and light cinema. It seems that the movie originates the catchlights effect used so creatively since then.&#xA;It is imaginative and lightly stimulating movie but without being &amp;ldquo;in your eyes&amp;rdquo; or trying to be overpowering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw it on somebody&amp;rsquo;s VHS at some point, which should mean it&amp;rsquo;s trashy.&#xA;But there are multiple conceptual niceties, and the bigger point is there too and it is not as transparent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality cinema, merciless specimen of the genre.&#xA;There is something missing about genres classification.&#xA;Probably names like &amp;ldquo;horror&amp;rdquo; are consumer-friendly tags.&#xA;But horror-action is a dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It should be my favorite Lynch even though I forgot when I watched his thing the last time.&#xA;Not that I&amp;rsquo;m going to rewatch this one any time soon, but it is too good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still primed by The Shining, and I still happen to develop understanding even though I don&amp;rsquo;t watch it.&#xA;Latest ideas were about the (tree?) wooden composition and the ball in the removed scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went through the Mad Max mostly through The Shining lens, where dynamics of action permits me doing such a thing by not being too hilarious.&#xA;The thing is, the movie does not resist such a frame if one just catches details and does not try to overimpose the whole plot or bigger decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whole experience with the movie for me was Snakes and Ladders.&#xA;And it took me some time to finish the maze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I got the &amp;ldquo;creative&amp;rdquo; answers, but analytical breadth is still there.&#xA;And digging it analytically is irrational and risks overstretching it at this point (again).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now in order to conclude such a complex &amp;ldquo;relationship&amp;rdquo; with a movie it asks to be terminated in some expressive or creative action also.&#xA;So I follow the example and express it by ordering visuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than five months on the wagon and I think I have satisfactory solution to The Shining.&#xA;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the tenth such realization over time, but the latest pieces of the puzzle weren&amp;rsquo;t rotating the whole picture,&#xA;which does not make them less powerful and brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the magnum opus and unreachable peak in the medium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months since the first conscious meeting with The Shining,&#xA;and I&amp;rsquo;m still afflicted by solving aspects of it.&#xA;Even though I took a break at one point, now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my approach.&#xA;My approach now is more goal/question-oriented, so it is more constrained.&#xA;Still, the movie can even enter dreams in some abstract way.&#xA;So I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to look into abstraction, and it gratifies, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were some interesting photographs posted recently, so it is a good point to report on the progress(ion).&#xA;While also pouring some reds into the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe it is my third watch.&#xA;Four years after my first watch, I was able to appreciate it, I think, if not fully, then substantially.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m siding with the director and not spoiling the interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t spoil because it is like telling a secret.&#xA;Sometimes it needs to be earned, so it’s not pearls before swine.&#xA;At times you don&amp;rsquo;t spoil because it is an embarrassment, and the kind that also needs to be earned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The populus not liking the movie is a good omen for considering it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought the movie &amp;ldquo;lacked&amp;rdquo; the canned laughter to trigger the public when they should laugh.&#xA;But then the movie delivered even that, so it got double laugh from me there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It got me into artsy bait initially, but then delivered some screwed take on The Red Shoes.&#xA;So the movie makes fun of not only consumers of trashy content but also pokes the other side of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scorsese dealing gateway drugs in a NY ghetto.&#xA;Primal flavour stays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of suspense of imagination moments.&#xA;The real such suspense opportunity would be in comparing this movie to the previous here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ambition&#34;&gt;Ambition&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume any abstract description has more spoilers than any specific detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an impressive project.&#xA;One can&amp;rsquo;t compliment a good thing if the compliment invalidates the experience of discovery.&#xA;But in the case of contextual references, it could be justified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So whoever knows some Buddhism and likes finding things on their own shouldn&amp;rsquo;t read this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the reference is this: a person should guard the doors of the senses to attain the right attitude, and with the right action, achieve the right consequence (reincarnation is relevant here).&#xA;So, toward the end, &amp;ldquo;safe journey and safe return&amp;rdquo; aren’t about physical safety.&#xA;And at that point, the movie can be seen in two ways — it could be the Dalai Lama moving out or a random soldier moving in.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an unorthodox move, but the red Chinese must feel green with envy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The certain dramatic beauty of nature makes me really think about whether dramatic suffering fits the place.&#xA;Kichijiro is an interesting and ambiguous character.&#xA;Clinging to one’s own religion in an environment hostile to it may be interpreted very differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I remember Scorsese mentioning how changing the end of the movie has changed the whole film.&#xA;I think when unexpected meanings emerge, that’s the juicy aspect for the artist.&#xA;And I’m content with exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been delighting in some Visconti recently and enjoying both the classy delivery and the captured vitality.&#xA;So I thought I might be more ready to appreciate this movie and give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually did appreciate the initial flower sequence more this time.&#xA;I was superficial the previous time, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably why I failed to watch the movie then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the fact, I can say that I liked the movie.&#xA;I got the impression that it&amp;rsquo;s more demanding on the viewer&amp;rsquo;s attention being broad and fast, so it may feel daunting at some point. But I think if that happens later during the watch, it&amp;rsquo;s most likely by design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I watched the movie with Jessica Lange.&#xA;It has dirty, raw realism and telegraphs things before they happen + the ending is the movie&amp;rsquo;s strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I rewatched Visconti&amp;rsquo;s rendering.&#xA;It is humorous, charming, and artful. It feels more relatable and delivers not once, but requires active imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch everything going on, and you see ropes to follow here and there, but the movie is too light-minded to care about rewatching.&#xA;I guess the single reason I write this is to mention that I like the naming for sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like how the horror genre makes a good background for mental balance matter.&#xA;I think a kind of non-rewatchability compared to more puzzling movies has its point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie has a sad subject, but it does not try to pull a tear from the viewer’s eye.&#xA;In fact, it features a mime and some funny scenes, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually a comedy.&#xA;It also features visuals of interest and a range of ambiguity, so I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to rewatch it, even though the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t force that per se.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spectacular rat race.&#xA;It seems that I missed all the fun in the first half,&#xA;but then it gets metaphorical all over the place.&#xA;So, it is my kind of movie, despite initially being in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I attempted to watch Age of Innocence,&#xA;then the second iteration was to maybe try The Passion of the Christ.&#xA;Finally, I landed on The Wicker Man, and it was accomplished with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good part is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to suffer while watching,&#xA;and it is not entirely explicit as Midsommar or as shallow as Age of Innocence (as the first 10 minutes impress).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad the guy got some sleep to the end of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also enjoyed the insightful commentary and got an idea for visuals in the process.&#xA;At one point, the script writer uses the word &amp;ldquo;racism&amp;rdquo; around eight times, which is a lot of repetition, and as a writer, he should know that.&#xA;Then he says how they were searching for a reference white pimp in NY, but didn&amp;rsquo;t find one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked how the picture was made; it is necessary to see it from that perspective.&#xA;But as it happens when the viewer reduces the picture to their own level of thinking,&#xA;I shall proceed and make this post about alcohol in movies I saw relatively recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is so much alcohol in Casablanca that movie disc boxes should be tagged with excise taxes.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that final bottle drop has any subconscious effect from that perspective,&#xA;but I observed some dynamics in my own relation to alcohol that was changing with the level of conscious understanding of other pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;picture&#34;&gt;Picture&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the movie is meant to give general impressions, without making too many points.&#xA;This means that somewhat loose characters and plot are just what they are.&#xA;I say characters and interactions are not meaningfully reducible because this is not The Irishman, where you have plenty of time to analyze.&#xA;Mean Streets is a completely different world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I can see it as a comment on the misuse of religion,&#xA;and the obvious character development is: &amp;ldquo;queen getting balls&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;But then, the next idea is that Charlie&amp;rsquo;s downfall was deterministic.&#xA;So, there are layers I missed that created rewatch value and a kind of play-of-shadows dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The picture offers enough understated entertainment.&#xA;Not that I watched too closely, but on the obvious side are these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fish&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;big ears&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Raging Bull clothes hanger and other small references (accidental or not)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;clock from The Shining -&amp;gt; cyan marriage&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The picture obviously features some interesting characters.&#xA;Looking deeper into character flaws would be a different genre of content consumption.&#xA;So, I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to dive into that right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it shows alpha and beta dynamics in criminal systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To solve is to reduce complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given an ambiguous picture,&#xA;It looks like what one considers to be the solution is formed by a sequence of what one considers to be bigger insights or stimuli the person could see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I considered The Shining to be generally solved as I saw it for some time.&#xA;But the picture always leaves some breadcrumbs one can follow further into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now my impression is that opportunities are seemingly infinite in it.&#xA;So one can read the picture similar to reading coffee residue.&#xA;At some point I get too much caffeine to the extent that it physically does not feel good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;movie&#34;&gt;Movie&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like light puzzle entertainment, you are fed little stimulants all the way, including visual entertainment, then some bigger things also get resolved to the end.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m relatively new to movies that just resolve without hidden corners or layers, so I need to consider it a neutral feature, if not positive in its own way.&#xA;Some parts are funny (~in a good way), the core action ain&amp;rsquo;t so (in a bad way).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are references and reinterpretations of some tools used in The Shining inside of this picture.&#xA;The most outstanding verbal reference for me was &amp;ldquo;Come out, come out&amp;rdquo;, spoken outside, because the reference is both implicit and strong, so I predicted it a number of seconds before it actually occurs.&#xA;Just thinking about how the director produced that effect makes for some bad-looking depth packed into that scene.&#xA;So medium development context helps in understanding scenes and details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Abstractest spoilers warning possible. AK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;content&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie works with contradiction coming from impossibility of full truth and perfect justice.&#xA;It shows how violence defines what truth is and the dead end of that way if any justice is to be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, protagonist dispenses violence with his version of justice/truth onto captured German soldiers.&#xA;Then he has to violently protect one-self from what he denies to be the truth, imposing this onto others.&#xA;When he himself is captured, and is surely in the corner, the last resort is violence against oneself.&#xA;What mirrors the German officer from his memories, but this time the roles have switched.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;point&#34;&gt;Point&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experiments reveal something about the subject.&#xA;Among other things these three definetly have the viewer as their subject too: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut.&#xA;Also those movies are talked about more broadly than understood, so this makes for some interesting social experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My observations at this point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;people use different strategies and faculties for solving these movies and it is very contextual&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there is almost a protection mechanism around the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;, that is &amp;ldquo;understood&amp;rdquo; by all parties, in part because &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; is realized in executing those strategies, not in completing the search&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lately thinking about the idea of shadow archetype-wise very abstractly.&#xA;Looking into these dynamics is in a way that shadow area for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;mist&#34;&gt;Mist&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recall my first experience of the movie.&#xA;So there is this interesting state when you got some cinema literacy and&#xA;may have the illusion that you can&amp;rsquo;t see it with fresh eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the whole remote Hotel theme invokes that feeling that there&#xA;are experiences remote in the past that you can&amp;rsquo;t even recall, not to say about making sense of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;realism&#34;&gt;Realism&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched the movie in a headset.&#xA;I generally control fear response by having controlled volume and being analytical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-impression&#34;&gt;First impression&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality movie with meditative texture.&#xA;It gives some shallow visual entertainment in the process.&#xA;So it makes the impression of being mostly shallow too.&#xA;And there is not much motivation to rewatch it by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;second-layer&#34;&gt;Second layer&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it is a way deeper movie, I gave some scenes another look.&#xA;And yes, there is more to it, so depth is there, and it is up for rewatch at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there was general context of hearing how this was one of the movies notably influenced by Powell and Pressburger cinema.&#xA;The movie&amp;rsquo;s title sequence by itself confirms that art-cinema aspect being there.&#xA;And actually it confirms the reference, if one wants to see it from that angle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching it from that perspective ain&amp;rsquo;t satisaction guaranteed kind of entertainment, but it actually gave me some enjoyable parallels.&#xA;And that development and difference compared to the reference tool used is what enriches overall cinema experience by structuring it more.&#xA;Also it gave some of own picture&amp;rsquo;s language that could be missed without that kind of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the movie and then read the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the book is more introspective, personal and imaginative, while the movie has more of the class component and is on the real side, which has its own depth that I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie is consistently visual.&#xA;But the book features outstanding stones scene that I appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also the book had this effect that movie would not have.&#xA;It made me to recall some of old memories about conscript military service.&#xA;It was as remote location as one can get excluding locations considered remote for harsh climate conditions.&#xA;The place also was with ruins here and there because of earthquakes years before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As any good film this documentary addresses different audiences&amp;rsquo; interests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be seen as an overview and an introduction to the cinema of Powel and Pressburger also branded The Archers.&#xA;I like how creative paths of that collaboration and M. Scorsese are interwoven in different ways.&#xA;So, it can be seen as double documentary to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this is not a documentary in any dull sense because the subject cinema is so creative, expressive and as strong or as subtle as one allows it to be.&#xA;In 2023 BFI called the event celebrating the artists &amp;ldquo;Cinema Unbound&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The simpler/more-explicit movie so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to stick to just first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expected the movie to be about cardinal topic.&#xA;The topic is human state and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;spoilers-if-you-like&#34;&gt;Spoilers if you like&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The topic is shown from two angles overimposed: intelligence and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The black rectangular prism means evolution crossing some limit.&#xA;All four key appearances signify something fundamental to human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First: &amp;ldquo;monkeys&amp;rdquo; get natural intelligence evolved&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second: superficially - artificial intelligence gets discovered, but I&amp;rsquo;d say there is more to that AI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third: is experience of body generation complexity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fourth: is limit of unacheivable by every previous generation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie feels very humane at certain moments dispite it being not the most cozy watch.&#xA;Understanding the whole thing makes it a comedy too.&#xA;This makes for an interesting depth in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a breaking of the fourth wall element in theater/cinema.&#xA;I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools.&#xA;For example, in Killer&amp;rsquo;s of the Flower Moon, there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth wall&#xA;and one obvious one at the end.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d say, even if sneaky, they signify key moments to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For whatever questionable reason, I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently.&#xA;Somehow, the director, even if the he has great work, tends to be mentioned by Russian speaking people who signal sophistication.&#xA;And I&amp;rsquo;m fine if somebody references, at least after watching it, if the reference is good.&#xA;But in that case, the referencer probably asked chat-gpt and got hallucinated and confused mix of stuff.&#xA;So it was the worst possible reference, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to think about that.&#xA;(BTW: I use chat-gpt to put commas around; hopefully, that does not make my references bad).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before&#34;&gt;Before&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What got my attention to the movie is unexpected change on one channel.&#xA;The channel had comments turned off and occasionally different art was posted there.&#xA;Then there appeared somewhat simplistic yet dissonant review of the movie and comments went turned on.&#xA;I knew that M. Scorsese looks into ethnical differences and criminal characters and groups.&#xA;I think I guessed right at the time what moved the channel&amp;rsquo;s author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and &amp;ldquo;flight from Berlin&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a type of lucid Disney movie crossing into a horror film. The earliest erotic movie. Melodrama about nuns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers may lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;team&#34;&gt;Team&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In director&amp;rsquo;s commentary M. Powell mentions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;high quality of the team and art department&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cases of intrinsic match of actors to roles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;directors role of believing in the project&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how the team kind of lived through the movie (without big picture possibly?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this final point probably assumes a degree of improvisation on actors part in the process&#xA;and also a degree of freedom during the editing part.&#xA;Although I have information about the director being very exacting.&#xA;So I have no idea really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there.&#xA;After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights.&#xA;And this sets the standard and expectation.&#xA;So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used.&#xA;But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rich movie, unforgettable images&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lots of echoes inside&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time.&#xA;Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie.&#xA;The more patched nature of the movie may relax constrains on interpretation of scenes to some extent.&#xA;The movie even has abstract poetry read at some point, what highlights and invites ambiguity.&#xA;Level of details and different themes touched makes for a rich mix and questions posed of different level of visibility anchor viewer to pay attention.&#xA;Echoes in the movie helps you compose the picture in non-linear way for even richer composition to go beyond superficial limits of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg.&#xA;I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it.&#xA;Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it.&#xA;This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be.&#xA;Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them.&#xA;Then surely given unusual state of affairs of roles Al Pacino offers another entertaining piece of the picture.&#xA;Also I think innate visual fabric of the movie may suggest some further ideas but it is as if some frame or composition is not there to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched the piece again and saw some of it&amp;rsquo;s riches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called &amp;ldquo;unveiling&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell&amp;rsquo;Orsa right there.&#xA;But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don&amp;rsquo;t know why yet.&#xA;Is it another echo? But this one is subtle enough to puzzle you whether it is there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After getting excited by New York Stories.&#xA;I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say it can&amp;rsquo;t be other way.&#xA;Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind.&#xA;So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Talking about the first segment here.&#xA;Awesome and controversial piece.&#xA;Watching this only one time is not getting the value.&#xA;And general context of watching should be different too so I&amp;#39;d recommend arbitrary time gap between sessions.&#xA;Also spoilers here may spoil the second watch too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;The first segment of New York Stories is by Martin Scorsese.&#xA;I watched the segment twice with some delay and wrote this later still.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;path&#34;&gt;Path&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.&#xA;It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.&#xA;It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.&#xA;Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.&#xA;Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.&#xA;Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.&#xA;Both in verses and the video on top of them.&#xA;This time the experience was without the &amp;ldquo;noise in torn-out ears without head&amp;rdquo; in the process&#xA;and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.&#xA;Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial.&#xA;May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The director is a master of visual language.&#xA;This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows.&#xA;After that you see details that are necessary but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip them to not elaborate further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ended-up watching some movies recently.&#xA;One of them ended-up being Memento.&#xA;Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;idea&#34;&gt;Idea&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place.&#xA;This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;movie&#34;&gt;Movie&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order.&#xA;Each has its own references mostly in regard to questions of memory and communication.&#xA;I found topic of drugs abuse and isolation being represented too but more indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good soviet movie about middle-aged males gathering for a trip.&#xA;The viewer has lots of moments of reflection on deep matters of existence and life.&#xA;Offering nostalgia and sharpened sense of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie was mentioned on Arestovich&amp;rsquo;s program twice AFAIK.&#xA;So that added it to my list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally after having listened to some classics it is especially hard to&#xA;get me interesting in a soviet movie with military theme.&#xA;But this one was chosen and it got my attention from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert and all that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago.&#xA;It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;many things at once is how I see it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it succeeded at confusing me at points surely&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;effect: not scared but puzzled&#xA;(which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes,&#xA;different personalities,&#xA;direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or&#xA;you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fearless desensitized vs fearless normal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;topic of desensitization by the industry&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;enjoyed accents&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quality&#34;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though&#xA;there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling&#xA;but the director did his work&#xA;by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things&#xA;and producing effects, &amp;ldquo;things perceptable and the general level&#xA;is not distracting your from products&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;so there should be rewatch value from that for sure;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad&#xA;so you have your time to think about stuff,&#xA;I liked that for sure,&#xA;yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;exceprts&#34;&gt;Exceprts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That &amp;ldquo;he is the director&amp;rdquo; I understood it (but not at that moment)&#xA;as both:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-context&#34;&gt;Some Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems.&#xA;Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out.&#xA;So the opportunity to do that was realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon.&#xA;And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop.&#xA;So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;city-lights&#34;&gt;City Lights&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting.&#xA;And compared to the earliest short silent comedy that I have had an opportunity to check.&#xA;This definetly looks like more serios work.&#xA;Surely you get what is expected - extremely comical scenes.&#xA;And you get more variability because of length.&#xA;But you also get the main plot that makes it a real movie.&#xA;And there is something more I believe.&#xA;Maybe it is that you can alter the speed of the show&#xA;when you are not constrained by the short format.&#xA;And Charlie uses that option to have scenes of different pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I see this.&#xA;But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used.&#xA;It makes things more understandable and more like communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I liked how director emphasises certain places.&#xA;That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience.&#xA;Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers Land&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie has multiple parts.&#xA;I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in.&#xA;And then to write more gave another look.&#xA;And then I could not resisit another look&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The setting is in the Alps.&#xA;Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls.&#xA;Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points&amp;hellip;&#xA;Red color is favored there.&#xA;Some shots are very likeable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second when he revives the diva;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it&amp;rsquo;s place.&#xA;The name suggests that too. Maybe I should just read the list of all plots finally so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to analyze but maybe something is lost then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched alot of stuff in 2021 that I&amp;rsquo;d like to write something about just to see how it goes.&#xA;But there should be a starting point somewhere and the most recent movie is the subject of the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie is short so the post should follow the shape of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I have seen is lots of patches with with some light humour everywhere in between.&#xA;Patches are different and that may be confusing because it looks like there are serious topics interwoven.&#xA;But in the end humour is the unifying line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese.&#xA;I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea.&#xA;I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle.&#xA;Most of the time music itself did not attract me.&#xA;And that got me interested even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You see quality from the start.&#xA;A movie about life and play that says it for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them.&#xA;So there is a rewatch value added just by that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already.&#xA;But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with. Only if it is timed well after other high quality content to compare to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visually and overall I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.&#xA;But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially.&#xA;So one may think that the first thing was there just to&#xA;create an illusion of something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched it without subtitles or anything.&#xA;Actually didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example.&#xA;Some things should not be played because they can&amp;rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe.&#xA;But probably I&amp;rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.&#xA;Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.&#xA;Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.&#xA;I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You see the good quality there.&#xA;There is class I believe too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I&amp;rsquo;m used to capture but it is definetly visible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish.&#xA;At some points you may think: &amp;ldquo;What kind of dialogs are these?&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;You already know what is being said but they still dictate own pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;also some interesting shots overall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in that &amp;ldquo;surrounding&amp;rdquo; Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First. Visually interesting without question.&#xA;I also liked characters there.&#xA;Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze.&#xA;And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is this word &amp;ldquo;soviet intelligent-sy&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time.&#xA;And I hear this from time to time that conformists are intelligent because it is expedient thing to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought that &amp;ldquo;extremely funny nonsense&amp;rdquo; describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive.&#xA;So that it may require some tools to weave that.&#xA;Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow&#xA;but it always finds a way to astonish you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective.&#xA;I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I&amp;rsquo;m so used to like.&#xA;But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation.&#xA;It is just that odd and in a way immutable.&#xA;This way of looking at it seems new to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: some spoilers ahead&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is.&#xA;One random phrase can be just so fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beginning predictably left me not excited.&#xA;The movie provides some words to describe it: &amp;ldquo;too modern&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;And the word &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; came to my mind too.&#xA;No idea why.&#xA;I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first third you get to see some &lt;strong&gt;development&lt;/strong&gt; and get intrigued by it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides&#xA;similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that it works this way:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well.&#xA;Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing.&#xA;And that I&amp;rsquo;m not the right audience for the theme overall.&#xA;And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work.&#xA;At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say&amp;hellip;&#xA;I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some nice shots are present&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pace is not for me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;messy so called &amp;ldquo;psychological&amp;rdquo; stuff about characters&#xA;being unhappy and all that does not attract me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ugly sounds play from time to time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notables:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway visually I&amp;rsquo;m just too easy to impress so I liked many &amp;ldquo;shots&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was.&#xA;First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background.&#xA;Now I decided to try another one and you guess what.&#xA;It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits.&#xA;Then it contrasts it by some piano notes.&#xA;But anyway I have no idea what to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The one by Zeffirelli.&#xA;Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first impression is what is called &amp;ldquo;Tube sound&amp;rdquo; in Russia at least.&#xA;So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case.&#xA;After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive&#xA;it is quality of the movie too.&#xA;It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images.&#xA;As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision.&#xA;And it was compelling in some way to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too.&#xA;So the director says that the beauty and more superficial/temporal is there to be put to use and reaped somehow.&#xA;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand the idea deep but the sequence was too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched the movie.&#xA;It seems more balanced than Interstellar.&#xA;It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that).&#xA;But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological.&#xA;Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense.&#xA;But later she does redefines herself against memory and negative experience in a positive sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception.&#xA;I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try.&#xA;So this post is about that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;positives&#34;&gt;Positives&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with positives to not be too harsh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially.&#xA;There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The movie is like a story with different aspects to it.&#xA;It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations.&#xA;But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s table is.&#xA;Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene.&#xA;And in such a way that I started to think how it should be looked at to see stuff this way&amp;hellip;&#xA;I even came-up with an idea about that but then I got more sober view on the scene in the context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first movie of the director.&#xA;I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall.&#xA;I put there thoughts I got from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scenes:&#xA;In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way&#xA;you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist.&#xA;The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use names here because they does not matter.&#xA;It is not a movie for rewatching for me.&#xA;I feel that that &amp;ldquo;dark freedom&amp;rdquo; mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive.&#xA;One the other hand it still takes it&amp;rsquo;s own place.&#xA;With it&amp;rsquo;s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment.&#xA;But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view.&#xA;No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders. A female makes a poor choice of the husband. Then gets his attention by having somebody on a side with unintended consequences. Then basically tells him to solve the problem while not understandnig it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beautiful aesthetics.&#xA;Not to say about views of Venice and Italy.&#xA;Both strong feelings and something different also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :).&#xA;The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different.&#xA;So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a class difference that I see in different movies.&#xA;Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well.&#xA;But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially&#xA;to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching.&#xA;Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.&#xA;But actually it was a good movie for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched Obsession by Visconti.&#xA;I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers ahead of course.&#xA;I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lightning&#34;&gt;Lightning&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity.&#xA;You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don&amp;rsquo;t remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything.&#xA;And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was always visually interesting experience for me.&#xA;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect black and white movies being such rich medium.&#xA;Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it.&#xA;There are definetly smaller scenes that need another look to understand thinking of characters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to have some stuff written.&#xA;Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.&#xA;Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I can&amp;rsquo;t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;non-stelling&#34;&gt;Non-Stelling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning Nolan.&#xA;I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.&#xA;Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.&#xA;Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan&#xA;who is getting older :).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
