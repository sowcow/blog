      <description>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I&amp;rsquo;ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed.</description>

      <description>The movie is like a story with different aspects to it. It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations. But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.
One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini&amp;rsquo;s table is. Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene.</description>

      <description>My first movie of the director. I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall. I put there thoughts I got from it.
Scenes: In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist. The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t use names here because they does not matter. It is not a movie for rewatching for me. I feel that that &amp;ldquo;dark freedom&amp;rdquo; mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive. One the other hand it still takes it&amp;rsquo;s own place. With it&amp;rsquo;s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment. But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view. No idea why.
TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders.</description>

      <description>Beautiful aesthetics. Not to say about views of Venice and Italy. Both strong feelings and something different also.
My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :). The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different. So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!
There is a class difference that I see in different movies. Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.</description>

      <description>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well. But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching. Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.
 Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.</description>
