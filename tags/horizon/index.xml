      <description>Awoke and looked at the starts in the night. Eyes may be more relaxed and sensitive at that time. Also I assume they may move slower and movements may be less calibrated.&#xA;Some stars are clear, some are twinkling, and other are faint. While clear stars make a space with landmarks. Through twinkling one comes to faint and they are the interesting ones. They are both fish and water of the night sky.</description>

      <description>In the morning I looked at the the Moon movement against the horizon, spire and the clear sky. I assume stars could be similarly useful background too.&#xA;Movement perception and image perception are somewhat different systems as scientific evidence established and that idea is already entertaining by itself. But the subjective experience has it&amp;rsquo;s own weight.&#xA;And if you are me then surely you would have five interesting hypotheses about how your movement vector could have been biased and start writing about it until evidence shows to reasonable degree that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
