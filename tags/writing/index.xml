      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.&#xA;The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo; that I like for some reason. I assume they can be &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;m not that sure in my memory to be certain.&#xA;If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point.</description>

      <description>I have got to drinking only water couple of months ago. Before that I was a green-tea addict (only Flying Dragon).&#xA;And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being. And also to compensate a bit for carbs for starters I got to drink some diet soda.</description>
