      <description>I have got to drinking only water couple of months ago. Before that I was a green-tea addict (only Flying Dragon).
And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being. And also to compensate a bit for carbs for starters I got to drink some diet soda.</description>
