      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo; that I like for some reason.&#xA;I assume they can be &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;m not that sure in my memory to be certain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point.&#xA;But what exactly is the points I don&amp;rsquo;t understand yet so this page may help me in that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have got to drinking only water couple of months ago.&#xA;Before that I was a green-tea addict (only Flying Dragon).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being.&#xA;And also to compensate a bit for carbs for starters I got to drink some diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
