      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two videos that are related in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One is an old Ukrainian man showing destroyed military mashinery column part right around shattered village&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another is Ukrainian civillians who have maneged to talk-off a column to take a route not through their living place&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched the first one only and the man curses alot.&#xA;He praises Ukrainian military and curses Russian military.&#xA;While showing his house is destroyed by Ukrainians right with Russian mashinery.&#xA;You can hear that he is very confused by this.&#xA;So probably he was told in advance to leave his house so he got his life saved but now everything he knew is ruined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
