      <description>I beleive I found explanation to what caused all the 20th century chaos and ugliness.
One could say it is human nature or nature of existance overall. But I want to get more specific answer.
But even to say that the guy Marx started all the hastle without knowing it is not specific enough. Because one can still zoom-in to find for more fine answer.
I was thinking about it and I think I finally got it.</description>

      <description>I really like reading History of Gallic Wars by Caesar.
There are interesting small details everywhere: details about politics, contracts, warfare, decision making.
The narrative itself is also quite fascinating to me.
Also national differences that are depicted in the book are quite entertaining.</description>
