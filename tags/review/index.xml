      <description>General I started some new healthy behaviors but otherwise there was no acceleration compared to the previous month.&#xA;Reading I have finished small german language book that was laying around for too long I have started learning a new programming language so I have read a couple of books on it There are more books on it waiting for their turn Code I started playing with a physical engine I started playing with NNs Then I lost interest but I&amp;rsquo;m going to return this weekend because there are other motivating factors What didn&amp;rsquo;t Work Sun Tzu realy wasn&amp;rsquo;t right for me.</description>

      <description>Reading Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy. I wanted to write about it but it is not the case that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics. Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.&#xA;Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs. Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that. Even though author mildly argues for that also.</description>
