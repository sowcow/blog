      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed new and unexpected juice-making machine in the shop I visit periodically. But also my path to shop goes near a juice-drinking joint that got closed a couple of months ago.&#xA;Now since the joint got closed there are dead bugs that seem to accumulate inside. And it has a very good overview with a wall of glass. So it is in a way like this big insect aquarium. It would be entertaining but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that there is no limit to their accumulation.</description>
