      <description>Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.&#xA;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that people would do worse and voluntary. That error of underestimating idiocy and comedy of real-life I should stop committing.&#xA;Anyway some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.&#xA;At least now I know that the game is not as demanding physically and oxygen-wise as I thought. But also everybody got entertained by this new equipment.</description>

      <description>I have just returned from a walk. On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing. I tried to look at it and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow. So these &amp;ldquo;golden-hats&amp;rdquo; the church has make it possible to see it even further. I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.&#xA;There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays.</description>

      <description>In the old times hunters used to skin animals and sell the result.&#xA;These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor. But the skin gets even more expensive!&#xA;And with all the abundant money supply these days also. I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.&#xA;Wild times they are!</description>
