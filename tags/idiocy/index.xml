      <description>Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.
But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that people would do worse and voluntary. That error of underestimating idiocy of others I should stop committing.
Because of course some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.
While normally the game should be very demanding and oxygen-wise too. But in these times having a good game is not valuable anymore.</description>
