   <p>It is in a way like in that movie: Inception. There are forgotten situations that has power over you. And there are symbols that you get to have around instead. At some point you decode the symbols back.
It feels energetic but calming. It is too rare an experience to not record it....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn’t write about anything interesting.
Although I have started listening to Chesterton’s Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy. I’m not doing it methodically and I’m not really in control of personal time now.
So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.
First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like and then I move to something else....</p>

   <p>I think this post spoils the movie in a way. It can provide different experience to somebody else.
I have watched the movie. Although art is not somethig I know much, I have a couple of thoughts about art after the movie.
It is about making a name So the stuff modernists produce by just exploring the medium before others done it is worth as much as random numbers. But the name can make it winning lottery ticket numbers....</p>

   <p>– Hear me today discoursing in the house of Quadratus.
– Why should I hear you? Do you wish to show me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together man. And what good will it do you?
So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus. The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.
The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is also entertaining and with a lot of humour....</p>

    <h2>Excitement</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Another interesting insight from reading GTD is that there is a level of positive feelings you get from envisioning future results of your projects.
The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process. So the need to have “artificial sweeteners” goes down.
I think that excitement is the only reasonable expectation from your projects with this system....</p>

    <h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.
The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise. So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons. And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.
BTW I use org-mode to implement it. I am happy with the proccess....</p>

    <h2>Real Abstractions</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Abstractions are real.
Brains work with them.
And you can’t ignore what goes into your brain.
Things you can’t ignore are real for you.
Reality of production is reflected in the product.
Well. That was a tricky way to state that in the ideal world code quality is measured by the quality of abstractions....</p>

   <p>There is the idea of being in the moment.
And there is also an idea of future self.
I think the real idea is to have both things reconciled into single, repeatable understanding.
Otherwise you act not in your own interest....</p>

    <h2>Unconstrained Code</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I was looking at what I am doing wrong with my personal projects recently. And I think that part of the problem is this unconstrained approach.
So there is the propensity in people to be blindly optimistic about something. I found mine to be interfering with the code.
So I gotta learn some good constraints.
I’ll try some very directed and formal approach with explicit principles and compromises....</p>

    <h2>Complexity Order</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The title may be ambiguous/misleading. And chances are the idea is old.
The idea is that you add complexity in the right order. I think this is the real idea behind KISS/YAGNI/etc..
For me the right/wrong here is intuitive. I need to return to it later....</p>
