      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a project this summer so I had some random interactions over the internet.&#xA;Two of interactions had some strange quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One is what I recall as short and bald guy from post-Soviet territory.&#xA;He had a very attentive look as if at every moment he was looking at spinning slots.&#xA;He had a gambling project and he even said that involvement&#xA;in such projects is less ethically challenging than&#xA;being involved in prostitution business.&#xA;But then to support the claim he pulled some retro casino game box with &amp;ldquo;girl on the front cover&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;He thought that the disclaimer that the casino has no age limit should support his claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
