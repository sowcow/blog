      <title>Polar Positions</title>

      <description>On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions. While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.
It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance. Operational democracy is a demanding beast.</description>

      <title>Horizon</title>

      <description>Checked OED and Britannica as I have them. Also asked ChatGPT a bit but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful in this regard. One definition of horizon is a boundary line at which the earth and sky appear to meet. Other connotations are: boundary, limit, stage/level.
Add the notion of planning/time horizon and the difference it makes to how mind processes things. And this makes things interesting. This has to be a profound idea or image at least.</description>

      <title>Genre Change</title>

      <description>Path Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change. It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece. It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.
Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev. Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology. Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.</description>

      <description>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.
I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip them to not elaborate further.</description>

      <title>Tolerance</title>

      <description>From a perspective of a random non-educated yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.
I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it&amp;rsquo;s power.
I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions even if they are loading them.</description>

      <title>Democracy</title>

      <description>As I understand today the notion is applied to anything where elections are not obviously bought/stolen/taken by force.
And I have an impression that this word has really big halo not only among the demos but also part of some basic assumed ideology of talking/thinking classes.
Obviously it is too subvertable to be anything that can be called &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. But the recent war shows that in competition against more &amp;ldquo;archaic&amp;rdquo; system it wins (as it looks now).</description>
