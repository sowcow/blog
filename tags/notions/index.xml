      <description>I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).&#xA;There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not. It is very satisfying to see the director&amp;rsquo;s play and then he confirms it too.&#xA;That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested. It is a funny scene on the first look.&#xA;Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes.</description>

      <title>Polar Positions</title>

      <description>On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions. While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.&#xA;It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance. Operational democracy is a demanding beast.&#xA;Note I don&amp;rsquo;t pursue the topic systematically while complexities of it get my attention periodically. So I highlight some aspects that look new to me but since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a bigger picture yet there is a higher risk of misinterpretation and inherent incompleteness of statements.</description>

      <title>Horizon</title>

      <description>Checked OED and Britannica as I have them. Also asked ChatGPT a bit but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful in this regard. One definition of horizon is a boundary line at which the earth and sky appear to meet. Other connotations are: boundary, limit, stage/level.&#xA;Add the notion of planning/time horizon and the difference it makes to how mind processes things. And this makes things interesting. This has to be a profound idea or image at least.</description>

      <title>Genre Change</title>

      <description>Path Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change. It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece. It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.&#xA;Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev. Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology. Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.</description>

      <description>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.&#xA;The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one scene.&#xA;The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip them to not elaborate further.</description>

      <title>Tolerance</title>

      <description>From a perspective of a random non-educated yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.&#xA;I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it&amp;rsquo;s power.&#xA;I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions even if they are loading them.</description>

      <title>Democracy</title>

      <description>As I understand today the notion is applied to anything where elections are not obviously bought/stolen/taken by force.&#xA;And I have an impression that this word has really big halo not only among the demos but also part of some basic assumed ideology of talking/thinking classes.&#xA;Obviously it is too subvertable to be anything that can be called &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. But the recent war shows that in competition against more &amp;ldquo;archaic&amp;rdquo; system it wins (as it looks now).</description>
