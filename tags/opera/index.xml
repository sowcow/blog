      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visually and overall I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.&#xA;But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially.&#xA;So one may think that the first thing was there just to&#xA;create an illusion of something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched it without subtitles or anything.&#xA;Actually didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example.&#xA;Some things should not be played because they can&amp;rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe.&#xA;But probably I&amp;rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.&#xA;Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.&#xA;Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.&#xA;I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
