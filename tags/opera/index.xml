      <description>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.&#xA;Visually and overall I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new.</description>

      <description>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.&#xA;Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I&amp;rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can&amp;rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I&amp;rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.&#xA;This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.</description>
