      <description>Watched the piece again and saw some of it&amp;rsquo;s riches.&#xA;The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called &amp;ldquo;unveiling&amp;rdquo;. Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell&amp;rsquo;Orsa right there. But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.&#xA;Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.&#xA;Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don&amp;rsquo;t know why yet.</description>

      <description>Spoilers Land&#xA;The movie has multiple parts. I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in. And then to write more gave another look. And then I could not resisit another look&amp;hellip;&#xA;The setting is in the Alps. Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls. Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points&amp;hellip; Red color is favored there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.&#xA;I decided to have some stuff written. Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself. Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.&#xA;Also I can&amp;rsquo;t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.</description>
