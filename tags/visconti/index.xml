      <description>Spoilers Land
The movie has multiple parts. I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in. And then to write more gave another look. And then I could not resisit another look&amp;hellip;
The setting is in the Alps. Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls. Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points&amp;hellip; Red color is favored there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.
I decided to have some stuff written. Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself. Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.
Also I can&amp;rsquo;t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.</description>
