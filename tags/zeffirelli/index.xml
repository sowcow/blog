      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second when he revives the diva;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it&amp;rsquo;s place.&#xA;The name suggests that too. Maybe I should just read the list of all plots finally so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to analyze but maybe something is lost then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Visually and overall I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.&#xA;But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of the thing you expected initially.&#xA;So one may think that the first thing was there just to&#xA;create an illusion of something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched it without subtitles or anything.&#xA;Actually didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example.&#xA;Some things should not be played because they can&amp;rsquo;t be played truthfully I believe.&#xA;But probably I&amp;rsquo;m getting to be more open minded about the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.&#xA;Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.&#xA;Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.&#xA;I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watched some of it.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;other&#34;&gt;Other&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure.&#xA;(I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn&amp;rsquo;t really live through that time. But probably like here in Russia people still affected and see communism stuff even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t actually lived through it)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;also some interesting shots overall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in that &amp;ldquo;surrounding&amp;rdquo; Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beginning predictably left me not excited.&#xA;The movie provides some words to describe it: &amp;ldquo;too modern&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;And the word &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; came to my mind too.&#xA;No idea why.&#xA;I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first third you get to see some &lt;strong&gt;development&lt;/strong&gt; and get intrigued by it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Half Watch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides&#xA;similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that it works this way:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well.&#xA;Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing.&#xA;And that I&amp;rsquo;m not the right audience for the theme overall.&#xA;And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work.&#xA;At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
