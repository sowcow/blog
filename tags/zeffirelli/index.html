  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way. I’m not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.
The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.
 First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued; Second when he revives the diva; Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking; And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;  I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it’s place....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.
Visually and overall I’m attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers. But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don’t get enough of the thing you expected initially. So one may think that the first thing was there just to create an illusion of something new....</p>

    <h2>Cavalleria Rusticana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn’t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I’m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can’t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I’m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched some of it. I’ll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.
Other The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.
The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure. (I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn’t really live through that time....</p>

    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>

    <h2>Callas Forever</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.
The beginning predictably left me not excited. The movie provides some words to describe it: “too modern”. And the word “flat” came to my mind too. No idea why. I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.
At the end of the first third you get to see some development and get intrigued by it....</p>

    <h2>Half Watch</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).
It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.
Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.
I think that it works this way:...</p>

    <h2>Sparrow</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well. Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing. And that I’m not the right audience for the theme overall. And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.
During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work. At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet....</p>
