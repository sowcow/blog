      <description>Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant I can&amp;rsquo;t be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it&amp;rsquo;s pillars.
One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes. Modern communists use word oppression for that for example (because fools like words they don&amp;rsquo;t understand).
And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his &amp;ldquo;followers&amp;rdquo; who established that soviet union rule here should be liars and anything they say must be deception.</description>
