      <description>From a perspective of a random non-educated yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.
I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it&amp;rsquo;s power.
I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions even if they are loading them.</description>

      <description>As I understand today the notion is applied to anything where elections are not obviously bought/stolen/taken by force.
And I have an impression that this word has really big halo not only among the demos but also part of some basic assumed ideology of talking/thinking classes.
Obviously it is too subvertable to be anything that can be called &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;. But the recent war shows that in competition against more &amp;ldquo;archaic&amp;rdquo; system it wins (as it looks now).</description>
