      <description>This post is like a smell of a level-up of a kind.
For some time I wanted to write a post about where this simple writing experiment got me. Surely interest in arts is involved too.
What got me to that idea is that everytime I go for a walk I see something new. Something worth recording or trying to analyse in a post. So there is plenty of simple-looking experiences but in limited time non obvious how to approach in a contained way.</description>
