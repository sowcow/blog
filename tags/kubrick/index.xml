      <description>Context Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some of this director and I recall some things to be interesting I otherwise avoided watching his work because the name seemed too popular. Checked this one for a random reason. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about the choice for the first half maybe. But then the director delivered technically. And then I got to see the conception that is brilliant too.&#xA;Summary Delivered in colorful and crinkling packaging to distract the viewer; simultaneously Christmas and Halloween joke played right on the viewer; yet also having a personal down to earth snapshot of not obvious family business management at one point.</description>
