      <title>Contextless</title>

      <description>There is an interesting for me kind of posts where I explore near some more practical idea and that idea by itself may be only lightly implied or touched. Or I go on some random tangent and the case that got me writing is completely ignored.
In this one the tangent is that contextless things imply reactive behavior.
So I think that goal of advertisments for exapmle is to distract a person into situation for which the subject does not have the context ready.</description>

      <description>So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.
Abstract:
time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can&amp;rsquo;t put your attention on it the space around us is what is actually persistent and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it active attention is what I mean in the post.</description>
