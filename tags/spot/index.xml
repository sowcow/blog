      <description>In the morning I looked at the the Moon movement against the horizon, spire and the clear sky. I assume stars could be similarly useful background too.
Movement perception and image perception are somewhat different systems as scientific evidence established and that idea is already entertaining by itself. But the subjective experience has it&amp;rsquo;s own weight.
And if you are me then surely you would have five interesting hypotheses about how your movement vector could have been biased and start writing about it until evidence shows sufficiently that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
