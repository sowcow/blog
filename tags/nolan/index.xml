      <description>I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbj√¶rg. I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.&#xA;First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it. Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it. This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be. Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them.</description>

      <description>Context I ended-up watching some movies recently. One of them ended-up being Memento. Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.&#xA;Idea The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place. This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.&#xA;Movie The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order.</description>
