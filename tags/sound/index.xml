      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.&#xA;I bet there are good scientific theories but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:&#xA;social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not </description>
