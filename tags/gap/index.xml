      <description>I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.
They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
 clean background and possibly interesting lightening very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!) modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness) made in multiple shots narrative is delivered from this device that runs text narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material&amp;hellip;  The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.</description>
