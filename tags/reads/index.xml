      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to finally check on how smarter animals organize their groups.&#xA;I decided to start with ravens because they came to the mind recently.&#xA;This one was the first that came-out of the google although I know there is a recommendation on this kind of books that I need to dig-out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the beginning and there is that feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be told anything organizational.&#xA;Because the book goes into details on peculiar stuff that is cool from another point of view.&#xA;But otherwise the author keeps me starwed well like his ravens in aviary.&#xA;He makes a picture of different obstacles there to find-out this and that.&#xA;And there are interesting bits of what I wanted too of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
