      <description>I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all. But this time I decided to look into his content.
First I got into some debate youtube videos of him. And it was ok.
So I decided to look into his audiobook.
I found the first part quite informative for me:
 I really like biological facts about how things work Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others)  But then after 50% the real fun starts.</description>
