      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.
I decided to have some stuff written. Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself. Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.
Ludwig Very cool. The key melody is something.
I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.</description>

      <description>Analysis Meta Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.
Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.
I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the book. I have checked some comments on the internet.</description>
