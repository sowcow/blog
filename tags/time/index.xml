      <description>Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.&#xA;Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art. And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward. This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.&#xA;I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely. Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does.</description>
