      <description>Context I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately. Then I&amp;rsquo;ve read some Gombrich and there he features the painting. The painting straightened me up a bit.
Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself. This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.
Picture I enjoyed the piece for sure. If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findings then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well.</description>

      <description>Magical picture. It shows something so disconnected from the ground on one hand. On another hand it touches the human nature deeply. Monumental yet alive.</description>
