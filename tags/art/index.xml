      <description>Analysis Meta Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.
Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.
I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the book. I have checked some comments on the internet.</description>

      <description>I think this post spoils the movie in a way. It can provide different experience to somebody else.
 I have watched the movie. Although art is not somethig I know much, I have a couple of thoughts about art after the movie.
It is about making a name So the stuff modernists produce by just exploring the medium before others done it is worth as much as random numbers.</description>
