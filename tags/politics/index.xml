      <description>Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant I can&amp;rsquo;t be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it&amp;rsquo;s pillars.&#xA;One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes. Modern way is to call it oppression. Everybody loves new words.&#xA;And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his &amp;ldquo;followers&amp;rdquo; who established that soviet union rule here should be liars and anything they say must be deception.</description>

      <description>It is strange that in the top politics (the US) we see every next round hitting newst lows compared to previous rounds.&#xA;Normally in the nature even insects and bacteria evolve. Why politicians it seems devolve?&#xA;I mean if the &amp;ldquo;IQ-descent&amp;rdquo; theory is right then it should make sense. Then it would be cool to see nature restoring evolution back. So that all the good political-stuff is not in the past.</description>

      <description>While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it. The stuff even felt attractive in theory.&#xA;So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.&#xA;What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points. It didn&amp;rsquo;t look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan.</description>

      <description>I have a couple of things that I noticed while reading &amp;ldquo;Discrimination and Disparities&amp;rdquo; by T. Sowell.&#xA;Obviously the authour is a very logical and factual no BS guy.&#xA;The book is full of tricks politicans use and facts they tend to hide.&#xA;I noticed this disambiguation of the term &amp;ldquo;discrimination&amp;rdquo; by the author:&#xA;evidence based discrimination (1A): based on knowledge of traits and behavior of a given individual evidence based discrimination (1B): based on statistics on group behavior, traits arbitrary discrimination (2): arbitrary/irrational This is how I understood this.</description>

      <description>The word &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; is the most prominent example of language abuse for politics sake.&#xA;It is short and not some yet another pseudo scientific &amp;ldquo;-ism&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;-fobia&amp;rdquo;. So it looks more natural on the outset; It has &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; in it :) You can create new &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; every day by adding different perfixes; You can use it to extract something from somebody; Since it is vague term it can have broad uses especially when it comes to general public; It also informs users on how to act/behave when demanding something from others: righteously; </description>

      <title>Intellectual Toys</title>

      <description>I want to write an argument that there is a kind of people who like intellectual toys in certain area.&#xA;Earlier they found theology to be interesting.&#xA;Later such people were playing with philosophies, ideologies like communism.&#xA;And now such people may be writing code.&#xA;So people who are into religious fundamentalism or communism should definetly try coding.&#xA;Unfortunately in code you cannot use verbal tricks or force. But the good part is that you are not subject to the constrains of the real world either.</description>

      <description>I hope this blog is not going to be corrupted by politics too much.&#xA;One can sign a propaganda plakat. But one cannot sign a word. How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.&#xA;Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones. Words like &amp;ldquo;free market&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;pro-choice&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ABC rights&amp;rdquo;, etc&amp;hellip; Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.</description>
