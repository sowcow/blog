      <description>Overall I avoided flying before. So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.
I have this anchored to the planes wing.
When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me. And that was not very comfortable mode.
Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me.</description>

      <description>Background facts I have not practiced consistently. And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.
Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know meditation again. With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly. Also the alternative &amp;ldquo;object&amp;rdquo; is available. This is something new for me.</description>
