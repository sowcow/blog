      <description>So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so to have paid some attention.
In the morning some recognizable piano melody was returning to me but that seems not explicitly related to the dream.
Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between. I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place.</description>
