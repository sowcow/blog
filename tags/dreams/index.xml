      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I got a random dream some days ago.&#xA;In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn&amp;rsquo;t do for a number of years).&#xA;Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don&amp;rsquo;t have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between.&#xA;I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
