      <description>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatcheable and rich.
I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip them to not elaborate further.</description>

      <description>Non-Stelling First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.
Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.
Concerning Nolan. I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes. Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.</description>
