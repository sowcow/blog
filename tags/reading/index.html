  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Overview Best known piece where Plato poses big question vividly. The question touches many topics and can be seen from different angles. Humor lightens the reading while also bringing Socrates closer thus increasing the gravity of the question.
Angles obvious to me:
character vs shadows duty vs whatever high cost of truth vs mass of conformists individual ethics vs median masses mechanics/(im)morality political/ideological: “undemocratic logic” of considering what is best as opposed to wherever masses go political/class: rich young followers intergenerational and other decay/corruption of Athens inadequate court process, circus by definition Unforgettable quote: “by the dog I swear!...</p>

    <h2>How to Read a Book</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Then I try to install a habit for reading from time to time. Previous attempt was Faust that weights 2 kilos because of big format and stylistically different but exceptional pictures on every other page. Such pictures were competing with images in the text but I enjoyed both. One notable experience such book can give is when you are trying to analyze through some text and turn the page and see some unexpected picture....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Found-out that scribd has some good stuff that I wanted to check like this title. So I got over first three chapters in audio format. Looking at how it goes I would switch to the short version in this case.
Don’t eat while listening to it because the author does alot of stuff in the beginning for sure. I think consciously but who knows; Even though narrated by the author the experience is very copy-paste/so-conventional from the execution point of view....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Here I should have impressions on the works of the director.
Romeo and Juliet I’m not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.
I liked the main theme. And some scenes for sure. And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.
One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected)....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Abstract Open libraries are so cool. They motivate by themselves. Borrowing and kind-of a limit of time makes the book even more attractive.
Here I just do own notes to review them after I finished reading. It is not something pretending to have been carefully extracted and distilled. Sometimes in the process I just do not record stuff, sometimes I record alot more.

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Reading Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy. I wanted to write about it but it is not the case that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics. Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.
Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs. Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that. Even though author mildly argues for that also....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn’t write about anything interesting.
Although I have started listening to Chesterton’s Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy. I’m not doing it methodically and I’m not really in control of personal time now.
So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.
First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like and then I move to something else....</p>

   <p>– Hear me today discoursing in the house of Quadratus.
– Why should I hear you? Do you wish to show me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together man. And what good will it do you?
So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus. The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.
The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is also entertaining and with a lot of humour....</p>

   <p>I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all. But this time I decided to look into his content.
First I got into some debate youtube videos of him. And it was ok.
So I decided to look into his audiobook.
I found the first part quite informative for me:
I really like biological facts about how things work Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others) But then after 50% the real fun starts....</p>

    <h2>Collective Lies</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it. The stuff even felt attractive in theory.
So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.
What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points. It didn’t look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan....</p>
