    <h2>Lo Straniero / The Stranger</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well. But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching. Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.
 Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn’t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie....</p>

   <p>Disclaimer I’m totally amateur in all this stuff so this “early” perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.
Music Music was one of liberal arts education subjects. I strongly feel that it is for a reason.
On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it offers certain hope and positive expectations.
On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems....</p>

    <h2>Ossessione</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched Obsession by Visconti. I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.
Spoilers ahead of course. I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.
Lightning I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity. You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).
There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don’t remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues....</p>

    <h2>Sandra | Vaghe stelle dell&#39;Orsa</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything. And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.
Thoughts It was always visually interesting experience for me. I didn’t expect black and white movies being such rich medium. Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.
I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it....</p>

    <h2>Negatives</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I don’t have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.
The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental “images” that I like for some reason. I assume they can be “mine” but I’m not that sure in my memory to be certain.
If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point....</p>

    <h2>Abstract Fools</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>April fools day is approaching. But looking at trends this is going to be a century of fools anyway.
I thought about abstract notions like freedom, equality, security, even dignity that Visconti recently have impressed on me.
I beleive these notions if allowed to be regarded as meaningful without having them clearly defined create a bad habbit of not using reason at all and leave back doors to humans brains for more cunning ones to use....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>correction: it is not a chimps virus but I find that idea too entertaining still
So I got a shot of the vaccine Sputnik-V (I hope :).
Anyway I got a fever now as normal reaction. Basically I got a modified chimpanzee virus inside which is fun aspect of it.
Another interesting aspect is that I got it at the same day (I hope :) as the first citizen of the country....</p>

    <h2>Visconti</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.
I decided to have some stuff written. Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself. Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.
Also I can’t be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers....</p>

    <h2>Fish Rights</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Fishes moving in a flock.
Since humans are more advanced than fish I assume they are even better at such movements and maneuvers. They have more options to do that and have cool creative explanations for doing that.
My favorite flock in political waters are certain kind of individualists. Those who are all very unique of course but also equal for sure.
I bet those owning social networks hide alot of information about such flocks....</p>

    <h2>Death in Venice</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Analysis Meta Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.
Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.
I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.
I haven’t read the book. I have checked some comments on the internet....</p>
