      <description>Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.&#xA;Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.&#xA;Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and &amp;ldquo;flight from Berlin&amp;rdquo;. Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.&#xA;There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored.</description>

      <description>I have experienced the sudden escalation effect of the picture. I wonder if background information and other pictures influenced that experience too or the picture is self-contained.&#xA;I assume this picture for me has opened the door for other works of the author. I wonder if it casts a shadow too.&#xA;Spoilers the artist was involved in stabbing a person to death over gambling matters English naming of picture sounds sharp other paintings too often have or imply sharp objects </description>
