      <description>Previously I had this assumption that the most valuable language to learn must be most different from the native tongue. Now while learning some Serbian I got to see that learning similar language has it own advantages. Because of similarities it is easier to see parallels and to reflect back on parts of the native language that you were not aware of. And even though actual etymology may be not as straight-forward as it seems, the current picture of a language matters.</description>
