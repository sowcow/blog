      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not.&#xA;It is very satisfying to see the director&amp;rsquo;s play and then he confirms it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested.&#xA;It is a funny scene on the first look.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes.&#xA;That brings starting monologue of the director.&#xA;Then ultimately compare it to the final shot through the window.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Checked OED and Britannica as I have them. Also asked ChatGPT a bit but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful in this regard.&#xA;One definition of horizon is a boundary line at which the earth and sky appear to meet.&#xA;Other connotations are: boundary, limit, stage/level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add the notion of planning/time horizon and the difference it makes to how mind processes things.&#xA;And this makes things interesting.&#xA;This has to be a profound idea or image at least.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it as is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Genre Change</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;path&#34;&gt;Path&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.&#xA;It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.&#xA;It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.&#xA;Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.&#xA;Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.&#xA;Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.&#xA;Both in verses and the video on top of them.&#xA;This time the experience was without the &amp;ldquo;noise in torn-out ears without head&amp;rdquo; in the process&#xA;and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.&#xA;Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial.&#xA;May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The director is a master of visual language.&#xA;This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows.&#xA;After that you see details that are necessary but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip them to not elaborate further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
