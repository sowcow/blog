I hope this blog is not going to be corrupted by politics too much.

One can sign a propaganda plakat.
But one cannot sign a word.
How unfortunate it is that so much creativity is unattributed.

Enormous progress has been made from the old words to the new ones.
Words like "free market", "pro-choice", "ABC rights", etc...
Only true visionaries can see what new words the future holds for us.

## Background facts

I have not practiced consistently.
And I consumed alot of content about it at some point and have forgotten most of it.

## Thoughts

I'm getting to know meditation again.
With the first breathes you get to observe/experience Tanha directly.
Also the alternative "object" is available.
This is something new for me.

The title may be ambiguous/misleading.
And chances are the idea is old.

The idea is that you add complexity in the right order.
I think this is the real idea behind KISS/YAGNI/etc..

For me the right/wrong here is intuitive. I need to return to it later.

Constraints in mobile games are everywhere.
And they are so explicit.

I have no idea why people voluntary accept constraints.
Maybe because there are "opportunities" available around the constraints.

Somebody has to make a game where number of opportunities is decreacing all the time.
To observe the influence.

I was looking at what I am doing wrong with my personal projects recently.
And I think that part of the problem is this unconstrained approach.

So there is the propensity in people to be blindly optimistic about something.
I found mine to be interfering with the code.

So I gotta learn some good constraints.

I'll try some very directed and formal approach with explicit principles and compromises.

I want to write an argument that there is a kind of people who like intellectual toys in certain area.

Earlier they found theology to be interesting.

Later such people were playing with philosophies, ideologies like communism.

And now such people may be writing code.

So people who are into religious fundamentalism or communism should definetly try coding.

Unfortunately in code you cannot use verbal tricks or force.
But the good part is that you are not subject to the constrains of the real world either. [^1]

And in the mean time one can wage religious wars, conquests and ideological subversion on github.

Abstractions are real.

And you can't ignore what goes into your brain.

Things you can't ignore are real for you.

Reality of production is reflected in the product.

Well. That was a tricky way to state that in the ideal world code quality is measured by the quality of abstractions.

There are two benefits I have got from starting reading the GTD book.

1. The serenity that allows you to be more focused on the things at hands.
2. Previously unstated projects have come up like a surprise.

So there is more clarity just because of these two reasons.
And I eliminated some things I previously assumed to be crucial.

BTW I use org-mode to implement it.
I am happy with the proccess.

### upd: I finished reading the book.

*Concerning structure:*

1. The first part is the most useful - more practical one;
2. The second part was not that informative for me so I skipped most of it
  (because I implemented my GTD during the first part already);
3. The third part is good as well - more inspiring stuff;

*Overall:*

I liked the quotes and the language used very much.

The core content is great and very promising.

Another interesting insight from reading GTD
is that there is a level of positive feelings you
get from envisioning future results of your projects.

The level tends to go up with the clarity created by use of the process.
So the need to have "artificial sweeteners" goes down.

I think that excitement is the only reasonable
expectation from your projects with this system.

Also national differences that are depicted in the book are quite entertaining.

## This time

So I was about to visit a dentist today.
It was my last visit in this "session".
And I needed to fix a wisdom tooth.

And I randomly recollected that at some point in the past when a dentist was injecting anesthesia
it felt like they are injecting the needle right into the bone.

And since this was my last visit I felt like experimentating and not injecting anything this time.
But I wasn't sure if I will really decide to not use it.

In the end the decision was not that hard.
And I got two observations from it.

### 1. Danger overrides pain

(needle + hard to access tooth + recollection ~ danger);
Experimenting thing would not overwrite it in my case. I am not that hardcore.
But it was not danger by itself what informed my decision.
It only kept me from flaking :).

### 2. Middle-ish-intensity not-long pain was more like an attention signal, not like something important at all

I was focused on two other things - jaw position and throat state.
So pain was more like a signal to give attention there but there was nothing unexpected anyway.

## Some previous time

I do not plan to have a series of dentist posts at this point.
But I'd like to record previous experiences as well.

One was when I was really affected by it.
So I felt like I'm surrounded by enemies and every time after they were stopping
I had to remind myself that everybody around is acting in my interests as well.
I probably also was kind of vividly focusing on pain and what exactly they were doing.
And you get some kind of high after it is over.

Another time I got anesthesia and it didn't really work.
So I felt it but I was content.
Either because I was relaxed because I expected it to work (and there was nothing else to do anyway).
Or because the nature of that anesthesia - but that is unlikely.

## Summary

- experimenting/relaxed mindset is probably a good idea;
- pain fear/avoidance is overrided by expectation of danger;
- keeping track of dentist but not focusing exactly on their "working area" but on other bodily matters instead seems to be a good idea;

Today I noticed that I feel unusually proud of myself.
I thought that there has to be a reason for that.
And indeed I found couple of them.

Then I thought that feeling of pride is not really concious in it's source.

And then I thought about artificial sources.

Given say body positivity.
When say fat people are told to feel or pretend to be proud of themselves.
This is ambiguous.

Because there are three possible situations:

1. You just feel it and chances are there are **objective** reasons for that.
2. You perceive that outcome as desirable so you imitate some aspects of it to bring it closer to **reality**
   by making it part of your **decision making**;
3. You 100% fake it and surround youreslf with people who support your **illusion** and have acceptance **instead** of it;

Whether illusion is bad or not I have no idea.
I guess it should be.

But calling things their names and ordered, non-ambiguous thinking are objectively valuable traits for free individuals.

So I decided to put some thoughts about my coding here.
There are three of them.

## Copy-pasting

This is one of my time wasters. I have this expectation that copy-pasted block should just work.
But then there are little details that I miss that require a debugging session later.

Copy pasting by itself is not that evil.
It can be avoided by additional abstractions.
But you don't want to commit to any random abstraction either.
So it is okay to KISS stuff with copy pasting.

But every line of copied code has to be re-read and checked anyway.

## Comments

This old habbit to comment code just in case to return to it later.
And then I have to remove all comments when everything works.

Having more commits could solve this.

Also having more modules that I can replace file-wise is another interesting way.

## Simple values vs objects

So functions over values or more domain-kind-of functions over objects.

I need to ensure clear distinction between these.

The word "rights" is the most prominent example of language abuse for politics sake.

1. It is short and not some yet another pseudo scientific "-ism", "-fobia". So it looks more natural on the outset;
1. It has "right" in it :)
1. You can create new "rights" every day by adding different perfixes;
1. You can use it to extract something from somebody;
1. Since it is vague term it can have broad uses especially when it comes to general public;
1. It also informs users on how to act/behave when demanding something from others: righteously;

author: Alexander

I decided to write short summary and some ideas after reading "Out of the Tar Pit".

### Summary

It looks like a theoretical high level paper about comlexity in large codebases.

The main point can be statend in the form: eliminate stuff/separate certain parts of the system to reduce power/ability to introduce accedintal complexity.

What is being separated: essential state, essential logic, control.

Also proposed ways to implement these parts:
- state - relaitons
- logic - pure functions

### My Thoughts

I am pretty convinced that relations are the way to go for the essential state.

I need to really try the idea of logic being implemented with pure functions in rust.
The last time I was coding in rust it was pushing me in that direction.
But I haven't went this way 100%.
So I gotta try that.

### Dangers

There are people playing/experimenting with relational algebra and other stuff related to the paper.
I have an image that this is some high IQ area.

There is an opinion that the paper is overhyped and that it contradicts ideas in "Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming".

I have a couple of things that I noticed while reading "Discrimination and Disparities" by T. Sowell.

Obviously the authour is a very logical and factual no BS guy.

The book is full of tricks politicans use and facts they tend to hide.

I noticed this disambiguation of the term "discrimination" by the author:

- evidence based discrimination (1A): based on knowledge of traits and behavior of a given individual
- evidence based discrimination (1B): based on statistics on group behavior, traits
- arbitrary discrimination (2): arbitrary/irrational

### This is how I understood this.

Assuming that factual/true information allows for better cooperation:

- The 1A is advantageous for both parties;
- The 1B has smaller cost and smaller value for cooperation;
- The 2 is most likely to be harmful for cooperation;

The 2 is not really explored probably because there are too many lies around it.
For example it seems to be the go-to thing that certain kind of politicans attribute indiscriminally at any expedient case.

Also I think that about 2 there is alot of stuff written by different sociologists.

The author is a very down-to earth empirical guy.
So he writes about 2 only factual cases where it was harmful.
The only possible problem with this is that he does not address situations when it was advantageous or at least lack of such situations.
Or maybe I missed this part.

Also the author does not theorise about 2.
Maybe it is a good thing because what is the point in theorising about irrational.

The author writes in the spirit of making people better decision makers by giving them factual information.
I can't complain about that.

While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that
the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it.
The stuff even felt attractive in theory.

So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.

What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points.
It didn't look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan.
And they produce propaganda for their audience.

The problem with ideologies is that they are there for the ruled to beleive in.
And they are not in any way for informed decision making by the free people.

The assumption behind any ideology than uses propaganda (lies, abuse of logic/emotions/attention flaws)
is that the public is low-IQ and it can be used that way.

So it has to be kept that way.

I thought that ideologies are so 20th century.
But then also the data shows that IQ decreaces in some key countries.

So ideologies are still there and with trends like that they are not going anywhere.

I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all.
But this time I decided to look into his content.

First I got into some debate youtube videos of him.
And it was ok.

So I decided to look into his audiobook.

I found the first part quite informative for me:

- I really like biological facts about how things work
- Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me
- I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others)

But then after 50% the real fun starts.

The guy starts preaching like an exhalted priest before a crowd of astonished peasants.

He preaches stuff like:

- "you have sinned"
- "become aware of your covardness, haterd"
- "consider the murderousness of your own spirit"
- "pledge to alleviate all unnecessary pain and suffering"
- "because the only alternative is hell/nazi camps"

And the author uses german words and interjects holocaust stories here and there.
And forces readers to beleive that the meaning of life for them is to be some vegan-antifa-bodhisattva or so.

If you think this can't get more deranged than that.
Then you ain't seen nothin' yet.

The author starts reading (audio book) like he is crying until the end of the chapter.
I thought pure guy was forced to read that way.

And then to finally and irrevocably humiliate himself and intellect of anybody listening to this stuff the author proceeds with verbal images describing how good his idea of meaning is.

Literally stuff like: buddha sitting on a rose, etc...
(I am not listening to this stuff again to get exact quotes)

And I beleive that the key phrase in his crying part was: "when all evil of the past is justified".

## Omg

So I had to google this guy.
I found that he has some fanatical followers.

Obviously you can't attract smart people with stuff like that.

Anyway this was a good point to quit the book for me.
Because I have no idea what to expect from the guy.

As a psychologist so ho knows if he has some tricks up his sleeve.

And his content is not worth it for me to pay additional attention and to double check his stuff just in case he tries to deceive me somehow.

## Analysis

1. He first convinces audience that they are innately evil.
1. Then he provides them with meaning of life as
   actively not being as evil/bad as he convinced them they should
   image themselves
1. He literally says that if you disagree with him
   then you should be scared
1. He covers this stuff with crying (in audio version) and
   with a pile of irrelevant images

Anyway he is using manipulation.
There is no argument to refute.

When I see manipulation/dishonesty I assume bad will.

## Manipulation

He uses images alot.

At one point he writes how he saves his daughter from another misbehaving child.
At another point he writes how he forces a child to sleep.

I would not be surprised if stories like that can be used as part of manipulation over some audiences.

There are blog posts that analyze fallacies he often to uses.

Anyway it is not what I am into at this point.

So I am finished with the guy.

So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus.
The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.

The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is
also entertaining and with a lot of humour.

I greatly enjoyed both content and perfomance.
I am looking forward to listening more by the performer.
Also there is certain Greco-Roman aesthetics that adds value.

Content-wise general spirit felt familiar (Because I am not entirely new to stoicism
and other moral philosophy).
But the core logic and argument was more explicit than what I had known.

So main points that I take from the book now are:

1. Simple core argument
1. Practice of analyzing appearances
1. Effort

> I think this post spoils the movie in a way.
> It can provide different experience to somebody else.

I have watched the movie.
Although art is not somethig I know much,
I have a couple of thoughts about art after the movie.

## It is about making a name

So the stuff modernists produce by just exploring the medium
before others done it is worth as much as random numbers.
But the name can make it winning lottery ticket numbers.

They make a name by being first at something and
their stuff magically gains some market value among
those who invest into art.

## The movie is honest about art

Like the guy selling his wallpapers scene shows
the face of masses who will buy and pretend
that anything has value
just because it is sold to them properly.

## There are some weird and dramatic scenes

I do not watch stuff while being immersed into it these days so I ignored most of such scenes.

I am not watching movies for exaggregated stuff and wow-effect or
even to be influenced in any way by the stuff.

I wanted to watch a movie about art and it is a great choice for me
as somebody who is new to the topic.

## Architecture

Recently I started to pay attention to soviet architecture
artifacts around.
I started to be interested in the topic.
And after the movie I also started to be ok about
even boring but orderly stuff.

I am not sure what to think about the shift.

## Soviets

The movie showed the contrast between soviet and
modern western art at that point.
Ideas-wise I am not with soviets but in the movie if
I ignore "prodaganda" aspect I prefer conventional stuff soviets did.

## Too Different

The movie shows that that avant-garde stuff is something too different.
It is as different as using car beeping for safety in traffic and
using it for getting some kind of senses overflow
they do in the movie.

## My View On It

So this art is supposed to explore outside of rational but
personally I do not buy that it actually provides it.

I suspect it is just being sold properly and more likely
it explores humans status signaling and behaviors in modern city.

## Freedom

Dispite my scepsis over the value of this art itself I have a point about it's relation to something valuable.
It takes some value in it being by-product of free artists.
And free artists are by-product of abundance, prosperity and freedom generated.

So it is like a token signifying something good (abundance, freedom) even though it is only a byproduct of it.

I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn't write about anything interesting.

Although I have started listening to Chesterton's Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy.
I'm not doing it methodically and I'm not really in
control of personal time now.

So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.

First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like
and then I move to something else.
This time I plan to simplify it so much that
it does not involve trying some exciting and unknown
technology.

So basically I'm going to write ruby terminal app for personal
consumption to see how it goes.
The only exciting thing (outside ruby itself, but I know it well enough) is the
new typing system that I haven't had an opportunity to try
yet.

I have a lot of ideas so this is going to be fun.

And there are two aspects to the app.
First I'm going to be able to analyze patterns and try and see what works and what not.
And the second aspect is that the writing of it in predictable technology space itself should be a way to
reclaim some dedicated time for personal projects (I'll just start with just one pomodoro a day at the fixed time and see how it goes).

BTW. I've go my first month on a new project as my first actual full-time remote job.
Technology used there is not exactly what I'm good at but it goes well.
And the interesting part is that I got it on 31-th of december and there was so much randomness involved.
And if I didn't get it I would had to get something in-the-office.

Anyway the point of this blog is more about personal development stuff like reading.
Because coding I can do but reading and other niceties on the list require some special organization from me.

## Reading

Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy.
I wanted to write about it but it is not the case
that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics.
Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.

Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs.
Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that.
Even though author mildly argues for that also.

## Books

I have good stuff ready to read.
But I fell like I don't have enough focus to commit to it.

On one hand I want to get rid of small things I haven't finished yet.
On the other hand there are good bigger options that require focus/notes.

I have a book with Sun Tzu followed by 5+ other chinese old books.
I really like this content.
The plan is to have some time allocated for actual book reading.
I'll have it with chinese music also :).

## Review

Overall it looks like this blog is turning into monthly review kind of thing.
I actually considered this use earlier but I envisioned it in more data-based way.
And this still sounds like a good idea.
But the thing that is blocking me from that is that I really want to use own app for that.

And since I mentioned the app here is the status of it.
I started with simplistic ruby (it wasn't smart move).
Because I ended up either reinventing bikes or turning into standard rails+react.
And there is way more exciting idea I'm looking into now anyway (gamedev).

Anyway I have a wall calendar for some data accumulation.
So what I have is that I finally started to use my velo among other healthhy habbits.
And this happened in the last week of the month.

I am not sure if this is related to COVID-19 uncertaintry.
Or maybe also this idea that I need to write a review soon also contributed.

## Plans

1. General: Let's see if I can keep it with healthy behaviors;
1. Project: I have a crazy gamedev project idea. I have some simple next-steps and many future ideas of course;
1. Audio: I really want to try socratic dialogs by audible. They can be demanding but that is the point of it.
   Currently there is no alternative that I have in mind for the new month.
   Maybe except for german podcasts but I haven't tried them yet;
1. Video: I have some simple german videos ready to watch/listen.
1. Text: Sun Tzu+.

# General

I started some new healthy behaviors but otherwise there was no acceleration compared to the previous month.

# Reading

- I have finished small german language book that was laying around for too long
- I have started learning a new programming language so I have read a couple of books on it
- There are more books on it waiting for their turn

# Code

- I started playing with a physical engine
- I started playing with NNs
- Then I lost interest but I'm going to return this weekend
  because there are other motivating factors

# What didn't Work

Sun Tzu realy wasn't right for me. It requires certain state of mind/engagement to read for me. I can't just push through such book so I have put it off for now.

Audios also somehow are not what I'm ready to do by default.

# The Plan

I have no plan for now. I'll just continue what works.
There is no new thing I would try to incorporate at this point.

It is in a way like in that movie: Inception.
There are forgotten situations that has power over you.
And there are symbols that you get to have around instead.
At some point you decode the symbols back.

Got to have a glimpse of what russian socio-patriotical channel "star" or "zvezda" shows on sunday mornings.

- first there was an episode about how many more people will have cancer in the future
- then they had one with staged excerpts related to people being executed by firing squads and how scout who was around this went into the mental house
- then they got to international politics and what prospects should be there for the state

I do not do hatewatch normally. Also I think I invented a term ugly-watch for this stuff.

No idea why this trash has found its palce an a supposedly patriotical channel.

Anyway watching this stuff can make you think very orwellian stuff is going on.
But one can't assume intention when stupidity can be the case.

## Non-Stelling

First I watched The Godfather, a couple of Nolan movies, Coffee and Cigarettes.

Concerning The Godfather I also watched a comentary and analysis which also adds weight and value to the understanding of how the movie made.

Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :).

Concerning Coffee and Cigarettes.
The movie getting to be my tradition to watch every year or so.


## Stelling

I watched most of Stelling recently.

Disclaimer:
I'm not a movie enthusiast normally.
I cannot evaluate director's skill and tools they use although I can notice them from time to time.

But I like movies with rewatch value for sure and that implies they have hidden sides
that you don't recognize at first although you may have clues into them hanging around.

For example the most conspicuous mess of movies can be anything of Lynch.
It is intentionally and obviously "a salad" with very different foods rubbing each other
and the user should make sense from that their own way.

Back to the Stelling.

The Hollander is definetly a movie that takes it's unique place in your memory.
But for me the second watch (after a day or so after the first one) have provided that experience.

The first watch was not enough to put it near Lynch (by that score of being a rich food for interpretation).
Clues were there but not enough to be enchanted by them.

My memory does not hold plot stuff normally but more like unique visuals or some interactions.
There is a memorable "scene" or as I would like to say "a phrase" (Is it reading Brodsky has effects on me?).
There are sounds and non-related to the plot normally visuals that I remember.

I think that a good movie has a rewatch value soon while the memory is fresh.

I have got to drinking only water couple of months ago.
Before that I was a green-tea addict (only Flying Dragon).

And lately there I got into a nice mix of starting 6-minute productivity diary, meditating, cutting obvious carbs, and listening to a nice episode of elated podcast episode about fighting demons and love for every being.
And also to compensate a bit for carbs for starters I got to drink some diet soda.

And I noticed that days with that diet soda make me feel some of that love.

Anyway this effect is based on a contrast with days of only pure water (not even tea, forget alcohol or anything else).
Also I can't say yet if there is pronounced negative effect on days off the caffeine.

Also I can say that I got something like that from Flying Dragon previously but then I just started doing it every day which does not make much sense as I think now.
No idea yet if "volatility" way of doing it is more healthy long-term than just being in a stable mood.
But short term I try to do some writing for myself and I think you need some of that inspiration this way.

Anyway it all sounds so mechanical way of talking about inspiration.
But I'm looking at it from outside-in in a way.
I get good ideas alot but I don't have structure in place to be productive in a directed manner)
And some caffeine versus only pure water days can be a part of it.

# Analysis

## Meta

Being watching Visconti for the first time recently.

Decided to record a post on this one because it is more than it seems in many ways.

I plan to have this one without spoilers because I like myself to find things in movies
and there is no value in being explicit potentially ruining that for somebody.

I haven't read the book.
I have checked some comments on the internet.
And I assume the movie is better than the book given how Visconti uses his visual space.

## What it is not

So there is a dull interpretation that a movie is about some odd perverted but distant relation.

Although it is totally understandable that people can get too distracted and mislead by that stuff.

Even though the movie is ambiguous by intent.
One should be a fool to think that the movie is about that given how strong Visconti uses his tools to deliver another story.

Not idea what is the case in the book. But Visconti modified and added to the story in a strong way.

## What I have been able to see

Visconti changed a writer to a musician.
Added great dialogs with a friend about music.
And there are other things that if you have seen them then you can't unsee them through the movie.

I don't go into details but Visconti leaves very obvious clues.

The movie is rich in a sense that there are contrasts everywhere.
And there is likely to be some point behind each of them.

## What experience I lack for the movie

That reflection of Esmeralda in the mirror. It has to be related to a real painting or else there is something the director says.
Watching the The Flying Dutchman and now this movie pushes me a bit to to get my knowledge of the history visual arts to some level.

Music. I got a midi keyboard lately and was trying it as an entertainment.
Actually even a couple years before I tried another instrument but it didn't fit me.
Anyway in the movie I have found that I just ignore music or just experience it as a background
except for scenes where Visconti is very explicit about it.
I bet Visconti synthesised music and a picture in a way that is worth looknig into.
But bigger understanding of music at least may be needed here.

# Spoilers though!

## Favourite scene

My favorite scene is the scene of fiasco and how a friend musician Albert acts there.
I'm being cold and stingy in words here but the scene should say for itself.

Of course there are plenty of interesting scenes.


## Small observations and clues

These are not big ones but I couldn't resist to mention them.

One interesting interpretation is that Tadzio is an angel of death.
Which is cool.

The idea of duality is represented alot there I have a couple of ideas about that but I'll let it open.


## My interpretation

This is the biggest of spoilers I guess but not the biggest key that opens a road to this interpretation.

I haven't read much on the internet about the movie so I can't say if I'm writing anything new here.

One thing I have read is that Tadzio represents non-romantic beauty.

I can go more specifically and say that he represents a beautiful melody or sound that an artist seeks.
There are big clues supporting that.

When a human tries to be source of art he gets crushed by a fiasco.

When the composer actually finds that beautiful sound it goes far and wide from the artist
leaving him behind crushed.


# The Mother Of All Spoilers

While writing this post I came to understand the last scene so I will write that here too and with some support info.

I feel like finding this stuff is very gratifying. Maybe reading it can also be but why would I read other's reviews when I can watch the movie by myself?

If one wants to find such stuff on thir own they should practice paying attention and looking for interpretations.
Or watching multiple times can be used if the movie is of a such quality to provide more with the next session.


## What you can't unsee

Piano.


## The last scene

It can be interestingly interpreted as the angel of death charging an arrow.
There is probabably a truth to it.

The gesture is likely to have own meaning (some painting or the Sun).

But most importantly.

Tadzio puts a note to the notes staff created by the sea line.
I bet the note plays at the culmination.

## Very cool

Very cool that I have no training with music and I got my first midi keyboard just two months ago and was playing around.
Without that it would not be possible for me to solve the gesture.

And there are still plenty of signs or whole explicit aspects of that are left for interpretation. As it says in the movie: The art is ambiguous.

Visconti masterfully shapes the canvas to reveal ideas.
The movie actually revived my interest in music and visual arts.

Fishes moving in a flock.

Since humans are more advanced than fish I assume they are even better at such movements and maneuvers.
They have more options to do that and have cool creative explanations for doing that.

My favorite flock in political waters are certain kind of individualists.
Those who are all very unique of course but also equal for sure.

I bet those owning social networks hide alot of information about such flocks.
From the zoological point of view it should be very interesting and even scientifically necessary to have this information out.

I've been watching different Visconti movies these days for the first time.

I decided to have some stuff written.
Possibly not very important one but I feel like writing stuff can have some value by itself.
Maybe because the writing itself can help me to think and produce some analysis now or even if I will want to add something later.

Also I can't be certain if I keep this with or without spoilers.

### Ludwig

Very cool.
The key melody is really something (Wagner - Song of The Evening Star).

I think I lost some value because of lack of knowledge on historic persons.
I really want to know more about Elisabeth of Austria and Ludwig for sure.
Also relation of Otto to his mother may be of interest but I beleive the movie just points to that.
It is possibly rewatcheable for me at some point.

The key conversation I think is about the truth.
The truth distant or "impossible" versus the truth "simple" and available.

### The Damned

"Machiavellian" power struggle. Evils of another level but so ordinary and distanced.
So it is like a boiling frog movie where the degree of evil gets higher and higher and sneakily in a way.
So the viewer finds themselves boiled at the end.

To be honest I had to google about the last scene.
So I got it delivered with a delay.

I beleive the director puts multiple evils to the desk at a time.
So when the viewer expects one they are less sensitive to another happened and it sneaks that way.
But then one after another there is a pile of it deposited.
But because that play you didn't expect in the end there to be this much.

### Conversation Piece

I don't have much to say for some reason.
I guess there are differences so arbitrary that even if they are wast people still have more to share with each other.

My favorite mini-conversation is about modern pictures.
In one russian version it is translated in the worst terms.

### Death in Venice

Ambiguous. There is a separate post.

### Rocco and His Brothers

Very dramatic.
At the end there is an explanation so you don't need to google :).

It poses a question of "sacrafice" in a setting where people don't change.

### Leopard

Lots of aesthetics to see.
About aristocracy that is possibly lost in the new times.
Brighter.

### Bellissima

(I can't think too straight because of fever but I need to write it to close the topic)

Unnatural world demands and even parents ideas mess with a child.
Either because mother cheats or the girl is not fit for acting from the start and the mother is delusional.

I beleive it is about miscommunication also because
I have this memory of not understanding parents.

Anyway it is about certain dignity of an innocent person.

### La Terra Trema

There are many images in the movie that you remember.

While watching it I constantly catch myself thinking: "hey! this looks interesting just visually, why are you not paying attention to it?"

So given the movie is black and white random person would not think that it should be visually interesting but it is.

So you constantly see that there is work behind this and even if you don't understand tradeoffs and choices by the director you still perceive the work as having certain quality.

I'm writing this after a couple of days after watching it so lots of thoughts and angles I can't point to now.
One thing that is shown in the movie is that labor in powerty selects for certain character of people and punishes another kind.
I guess it punishes optimists because the cost of risk is too high.
And that selecton opens opportunities for others to exploit such people.

### Sandra | Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa

I got enough for a separate post here!

### Le Streghe

Natural vs artificial vs ugly.
Darker.

### Boccaccio

I remembered it as a fall.
Darker.

### Lo Straniero

A seperate post is there.

### White nights

Nice visually.
I enjoyed the feel of most of scenes being shot inside of a pavilion.
So even sky is artificial.

The story itself I considered to be annoying a bit.
In short random mediocrity gets to see something different and impossible.
Old ways do not satisfy anymore and in part becomes part the of impossible.

### Senso

I have a separate post here.

### L'Innocente | The Innocent

I wrote about it separatedly.

*correction*: it is not a chimps virus but I find that idea too entertaining still

So I got a shot of the vaccine Sputnik-V (I hope :).

Anyway I got a fever now as normal reaction.
Basically I got a modified chimpanzee virus inside which is fun aspect of it.

Another interesting aspect is that I got it at the same day (I hope :) as the first citizen of the country.

Also another reason to feel patriotic about it is that if russian people are not too eager to increase vaccination stats.
So I did a move and added to that statistics personally.

There is an aspect of doing it in own interest given how slow numbers go up and that I cannot rely on other people doing their shots.
But also while doing it I contribute to that stats.
So I felt very good after doing it.

Anyway it is interesting that the final "straw" was Andrey Movchans video (from London) where he discusses vaccines and recommends doing it in an interesting way.

I can't imagine say two years ago that I will:

1. take chips virus
2. by the advice of a financial manager from London
3. at the same day with the president
4. while feeling good about doing it

Humans are more complex than I thought.

April fools day is approaching.
But looking at trends this is going to be a century of fools anyway.

I thought about abstract notions like freedom, equality, security, even dignity that Visconti recently have impressed on me.

I beleive these notions if allowed to be regarded as meaningful without having them clearly defined create a bad habbit of not using reason at all and leave back doors to humans brains for more cunning ones to use.

The more abstract notion is the better food you are for priests and politicians.

I assume they can be "mine" but I'm not that sure in my memory to be certain.

If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point.
But what exactly is the points I don't understand yet so this page may help me in that.

### Context

I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything.
And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.

### Thoughts

It was always visually interesting experience for me.
I didn't expect black and white movies being such rich medium.
Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.

I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it.
There are definetly smaller scenes that need another look to understand thinking of characters.

Many scenes are remembered as atmospheric for sure.
After the movie I instantly rewatched the very distinctive scene in the garden.
And I got "rewatch value" right there from accidental phrases that reveal you more about characters.

Anyway It looks that Sandra takes her husband Andrew and goes back into the house of her youth to deal with some ceremony.
And personally also to meet and finish it with ghosts of the past.
So she meets her brother Gianni.

They both are blamed for the past in the movie.
And there are not much more details I beleive about that.

The brother didn't make it out of the past and he is being consumed by it.
He looks more intelligent and sophisticated at multiple occasions.
But his behavior is also very impulsive and irresponsible at other times.
I think he not once shows that dual nature at the same time even.

On one hand Sandra is simpler as mans discuss once.
But she ends up being more real person I beleive.
And she is the one future oriented.

I beleive in the beginning of the movie sequence from car touches that the future and the past theme.
(Although that part provides also some contrast I beleive between what Sandra and Gianni shows to Andrew - she shows light surface stuff and he shows dark and dangerous stuff)

### So

Sandra is the one who posesses agency and is not being posessed by deamons.

Even though the verse is quoted by Gianni and he is otherwise colorful character still.
I beleive it is Sandra who actually visits the place to see glimmering stars from her childhood house for the last time.

### Alternative

The next time I will watch the movie I will come from the assumption that blood-mixing didn't happen and there is something else.
Alot of scenes support that possibility I think.
But I think one should also disregard some scenes to have a consistant view in any way.

Also aristocratic aspect is there and I'm "not an expert" in this but I think that is another piece of mosaic that can be helpful in establishing certain angle on the story.

Having certain duality of main characters Visconti leaves space for interpreting it from the point of no blood-mixing at all.
Mother getting mentally healthy may be interesting.
Mother drugging being mentioned so there may be other things going on.
The figure of step father may need more looking into.

### Also

Also I like how everything is big in these movies.
And also realistic and convincing to such extent
that you consider the movie having is own dimension of existance.

Also smaller things looks so arbitrary after such big-things movie.

Concerning "sin" main characters committed in the past I beleive Visconti intentionally does not provide information.
So that viewer is not distracted by also bringing the past of characters so that the viewer is closer to the actual reality of what is happening.

Also Visconti uses piano playing to tell about gravity of "sins" before parents.
I'm not used to such scenes and great choices of tools of delivery.
I'll definetly continue watching quality movies because this is actual art in the medium.

### Notes

There is an observation about the scene when sandra goes down the ladder into some water facillity.
The ladder looks flat like it is drawn.
That would be a cool way to signify switch to imagination or a dream.

At the final scene Sandras mother makes same gesture that Sandra makes in the piano scene.
Is that a scene of the mother meeting her ghost too?
(The story mentions "them" giving her husband to nazis which sounds hard to beleive)

### Jewish aspect

The aspect is mentioned at different times.
And the biggest mention is even including nazi camps.
And that is too big of a thing to be mentioned arbitrary.

So I assume Visconti brings historic parallels.
Every peoples history has its ghosts in the garden.

Perhaps Visconti invites people not to be dragged by the ghosts and move forward.
Not only by individual ghosts but also by historic ones.

Watched Obsession by Visconti.
I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.

Spoilers ahead of course.
I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.

### Lightning

I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity.
You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).

There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don't remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues.

### Mind-dump

I thought that the beginning is a bit "raw" and is not the aesthetics I expected from Visconti.
I even caught myself thinking that Visconti wanted to make something for working class.

At the end of the part (before the murder) things get more cheerful.

And I think there is not only age difference but class difference that is being highlighted.

(I forgot names since I write this way later...)
(Also I want to sleep and this makes this to be very odd piece of text)

Males are more than blind in the beginning and alot of clues about females intentions are obvious.
So director is being direct with the viewer about what is going on.

Basically there are two males.
One is very down to earth owner of own place and business.
Another is traveling and not being bound by anythnig.

There are two notable females in the movie.
The main one is like a spider who uses both males to the fullest.
Another is a very interesting occurance is probably the option
more fitting to the "traveller" but he already covered by net at that point.
Not only by the "spider" but also by cops.

Closer to the end there is an interesting twist where
a future child is supposed to redeem the murderer-couple.
But the fate crushes them in a similar way they murdered the "owner".

Also interestingly fate is being "gracious" by giving everybody except
the "traveller" some euphoria and good time before their end.

One odd small scene is where "traveller"s friend is talking to cops.
I didn't understand what that is about.

(I hope this reads not as bad as I think)

### Disclaimer

I'm totally amateur in all this stuff so this "early" perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.

### Music

Music was one of liberal arts education subjects.
I strongly feel that it is for a reason.

On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it
offers certain hope and positive expectations.

On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems.
If being developed I think there can be similarities in perception.
So on the other hand it is as perceptual development as other arts if I'm right.

If that theory is pushed that I guess it is possible for music to have countours.
And then for trees or clouds to have own sounds.

### Movies

Also good movies.

Just by watching what director arranged artificially you get to look at things from a fresh angle.
So cool stuff can be found where it is not supposed to be.

NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well.
But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially
to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching.
Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.

---

Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn't excited to start watching it and delayed this movie.
But actually it was a good movie for me.

- Visually I liked this strange palette (no idea if it has a name but I assume it has).
- The movie does not contain reading poetry.
- It has some comedy and some stuff that seems to be absurd but there should be more precise way to describe it

Arthur, the main character is non-ambituous simple man, kind of ignorant about other people.
Probably disillusioned in some sense but having incomplete picture.

Probably by own folly he gets around low quality people and into trouble.

Then by the system he is being put down and executed more for being different.
And even more for not pretending to be like those who populate the system.

---

He does not care much in the beginning of the movie but events force him to experience different affects:

- love
- restlessness
- calmess based on deeper understanding of life
- and contempt based on ugly lows that humans can reach

But he experiences all that too late - soon before he is executed.

---

The character reminds me of myself at different points.

- sometimes I did not pretend where others would do, being more straight forward
- I got to be around low quality people at some point
- some lack of ambition or vision for the future

Although my lack of such kind-of-social smarts is of another nature and I think I have less simpicity (ignorance?) than the Stranger during most of the movie.

---

Interestingly that simpler random people: pimp (afaik), imprisoned arab, a dog owning gentelmen.
They treat Arthur better than those who are part of the system even if rightous and in authority.

So in a way this movie pushes me to redefinde what I consider to be lower quality people.
So even that pimp is a better person than those involved in the execution.

I found that I pay attention to the good quality views around me more.
Summer of course.

There is another thing possibly due to how my memory works.
It looks like it is the first time I pay this much attention.

And I think this is the case in many cases.

Like horison line with trees looks so much better.
Even colors of leafs and sky there.

Overall blossoming of course is so plentiful.
And color gradations on different trees tells you something about them.

I assume me starting to pay attention to arts and getting to know things makes me pay more attention this year.
I see that is not the first time me enjoying nature but this time it is more detailed.

Another theory is that I started to "care-less" about non-important stuff.
It is like when Larry David in his series found-out that he may be not jewish but white christian so he starts being less concerned and more easy.
I think same thing may be here in a way and that frees some attention resources.

I heave read about some strange practices that some marginal groups or individuals praticed.
So there was something like trying to force oneself into seeing non-existing things and not seeing things that are there.

It looks like these days there are adpets at every corner.
And they have acheived highest levels of trance.

I assume levels of subversion with the advent of mass media are so high.
That they don't need to pratice anything to get that state.
Distraction should be an important component too.

I feel like I knew how it is and then I have "fallen" from that to the good.

Reality likes to outperform fake stories.
Maybe because fake stuff is created from a limited angle on reality.

Beautiful aesthetics.
Not to say about views of Venice and Italy.
Both strong feelings and something different also.

My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :).
The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different.
So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!

There is a class difference that I see in different movies.
Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature.

Then first Franz acheives certain success that never was his.
Starts being "just himself" and gets ruined by lack of his illusion that he saw in mirrors.

Then he breaks Livia's illusion about that relationship.

At the culmination Livia is:
- put down as a female
- shown to be a traitor of closest people
- shown to be like him? (non-aristocratic, shallow person) while spending all aristocratic capital (that was never her?)

So she becomes indirectly a murderer also.

Big cost of:
- lofty illusions that mismatch the reality
- blindness to others and own nature (shallow/deep and male/female brains and confusing successfull crooks for nobility)
- (age and) class mismatch in relationships

---

Of course the husband being a complete fool also contributed.

- Also age difference.
- Not paying attention and not being able to control the wife.
- Not recognizing a "threat"

I guess the husband and very cooperative handmaid are comedic players there.

Human passions are compared to warfare it seems.
Interestingly that Livia enters the war scene to help Roberto.
But she gets conquered herself.
In this war some people died on a hill.
Some got ruined in passions and broken illusions.

Broken mirror I think summarizes events in the movie.

I don't use names here because they does not matter.
It is not a movie for rewatching for me.
I feel that that "dark freedom" mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive.
One the other hand it still takes it's own place.
With it's own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment.
But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view.
No idea why.

TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders. A female makes a poor choice of the husband. Then gets his attention by having somebody on a side with unintended consequences. Then basically tells him to solve the problem while not understandnig it.

On one hand at some times the story and scenes resemble a soap opera.
So I found myself thinking that this exploration of Visconti made me do impossible - watch something with that angle in it.
But I watched mostly into how he arranges scenes.
(Not that I know much and have reference points at this point but overall I want to get maximum from the director)

Obviously aristocratic views.
Main music theme resembled Death in Venice in its confusedness.

The last movie by Visconti.
Also last one of him that I have seen the first time.

I want to give another round to The Leopard for reasons I do not understand.

Interestingly that when the guy solved another problem I felt release of some tension.
And a minute before that when the guy took a sharp looking jewelry from a head of his mistress I expected some danger.
Also at different points in the movie the guy was fighting with rapiers.
I assume that jewelry taking scene was supposed to feel dangerous!

Anyway I think danger is not kind of tension I prefer to experience in movies.
My self image says that I prefer light comedic release of also light tension.
But I can watch messy stuff if it has trash aspect - so it is not serious.
Also if there is a food for brains but in this movie the food has some serious chemical smell around it if you ask me.

It is strange that in the top politics (the US) we see
every next round hitting newst lows compared to previous rounds.

Normally in the nature even insects and bacteria evolve.
Why politicians it seems devolve?

I mean if the "IQ-descent" theory is right then it should make sense.
Then it would be cool to see nature restoring evolution back.
So that all the good political-stuff is not in the past.

My first movie of the director.
I have seen some time ago and now decided to give a try to works of Antonioni overall.
I put there thoughts I got from it.

Scenes:
In the beginning credits are shown in an interesting way
you kind of see somethnig by through letters but you only see the gist.
The movie starts with fun-car, and then death-camp-looking corridor - contrast from the start.

What recurring images or relations I noticed:
- abundance of shape or options
- lack of "meaning" or content or stable attachment or certain identity
- afaik modernism everywhere

So I think it is about lack of meaning and modernism (or there is a better word).

That "event" in the park:
- either illusory "meaning" he finds and even touches but then no traces left
- or the murder of "meaning" (by the form?)

## Other notes

- Whether there was body at all I do not know what to think
- Interestingly the guys wife come's out almost like from a painting on a wall after the "painter scene"
- The latest dialog with his wife is odd, she does not ask what she wanted to ask
- I got so annoyed by the party scenes so I really liked the scene with open window after it is finished

## Overall

There are definetly interesting scenes.
But there is one negative indicator to this movie.
I almost decided to finish it with movies for some time for no apparent reason after this one.
Quitting things that fast is not a good sign so I will likely give a try to another director for now.

# Abstract

Open libraries are so cool.
They motivate by themselves.
Borrowing and kind-of a limit of time makes the book even more attractive.

Here I just do own notes to review them after I finished reading.
It is not something pretending to have been carefully extracted and distilled.
Sometimes in the process I just do not record stuff, sometimes I record alot more.

# The Book

Piano, Guided Sight-Reading.
[A New Approach to Piano Study.]
By Leonhard Deutsch.

It can be found and read on openlibrary.org or archive.org.

# Before

I'm subscribed to some quora topics (God forbid reading political stuff there).
And in piano topics email there was a comment on what is the most valuable skill.
And there was a reference to the book.

Also I feel like arts are a necessary language to know and to use. So I pursue this in a way.

# After

Interestingly I found stuff to be not as detailedly explained as I wanted.
But this process implies *imitation* by the student.

Also interestingly teacher is encouraged to learn from student too.
But not piano but pedagogy experience.

Anyway I assume it should be fun and stimulating thing to play around alone too.

# Notes

The author is smart.

The author has another book probably on psychology of students for teachers.
(Individual-psychologie im musikunterricht und in der musikerziehung.)

Ear, eye, hands cooperation.

The skill can fit for random enthusiasts who just want to have addittional source of fun and a path do develop misicanship.

Developing the skill requires focusing on accuracy and evenness.
While leaving fluency to be the fruit to be developed.

One developed skill is the ability to have utterly concentrated effort.
That is necessary for the resulting skill.

Three devices of development:
- rich study material
- approaching pianistic tasks/problems
- concentrated mental effort

There is a memory value for doing music costruction.

- the principle of cooperation: listening and playing simoultaneously
  (maybe some tool can be used there)

- there are initial difficulties to overcome first, then the progress is steady

- sight-reading is a stimulating task by itself (gamified by itself?)

- harmony, polyphony, form/architecture

- `The musical ear ... is measured by the complexity of the musical structure which he can grasp in all details.`

- `... infinitesimal shades ... reflect the player's temperament and frame of mind, his maturity and imagination ... whole personality`

# Practice Notes

- play the selected piece using both hands and in continuity
- see both hands staves together
- never look at the keyboard
- fingers go after the eyes
- easy and relaxed tempo, no stumbling or tripping - no metronome, adjust pace when needed
- mistakes handling - no process break? correct by ear?
- igrone fingering info
- both hands strike precisely simoultaneously
- even rather soft touch, pay attention to shades of expression
- not overly difficult, not non-challenging/non-stimulating at all
- choose what can be played slowly and meaningfully (more details in the book)
- shorter pieces repeat 3-4, longer: 2 times only or on several consecutive days only
  ignoring what degree of perfection is acheived
- work on several pieses, varied in style at the same time - stimulating this way
- sessions are not too long to have healthy concentration and interest
- ~1 hour a day will do (implied guided? homeworks - starting from 0.5 to 1 hour, addittionally?)
- have a list of pieces and records of practicing with notes (how the piece appeals, difficulties)
  review when returning to the piece later (see progress, understanding, taste)
- value of accompaniment
- most weak students are always on the verge of giving up
- during practice: not tired or bored
- in the beginning it is a rather strenuous job, but with growing experience you will gain security and ease
  your playing will become more and more colorful and fluent, and eventually your practicing hour will be
  a source of sheer enjoyment

I beleive I found explanation to what caused all the 20th century chaos and ugliness.

One could say it is human nature or nature of existance overall.
But I want to get more specific answer.

But even to say that the guy Marx started all the hastle without knowing it is not specific enough.
Because one can still zoom-in to find for more fine answer.

I was thinking about it and I think I finally got it.

It must be his beard.

The beard always felt opressed because it could only grow so much.
But the final drop was when the guy stopped coming it.
It got very revengeful and day by day every hair was being filled with anger.

When the plan riped the beard started to act.

First nasty beard startes to creep around his head until it is completely surrounded.
Then the second part of the plan is to start growing inside so it has access right inside the skull.
Finally the beard attached to the brain from all sides and started taking control of carriers thoughts.

The carrier initially got inspired by so many thoughts.
But then the beard took away all what was his own and
forged a tool for its own warfare against all.

Here I should have impressions on the works of the director.

# Romeo and Juliet

I'm not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.

I liked the main theme.
And some scenes for sure.
And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.

One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected).
And when it is over there is like a relief somehow.
But the next day afterglow is quite nice.

I didn't like overly dramatic suicide stuff for sure.
And when they do it quick like there is a train they don't want to miss.
Or when they use steel.
This incurs disbelief if you ask me.
But the stuff is not supposed to be realistic or overglorified so such messy scenes are the price to pay for exaggregation of the story.

# Tea with Mussolini

I wrote a separate post.

# Hamlet

I should write more at the new post.

# Brother Sun, Sister Moon

I have a post on it.

# The Taming of the Shrew

The post can be found somewhere around.

The movie is like a story with different aspects to it.
It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations.
But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.

One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini's table is.
Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene.
And in such a way that I started to think how it should be looked at to see stuff this way...
I even came-up with an idea about that but then I got more sober view on the scene in the context.

So it is almost like the director contrasts strong way of imposing stuff (Mussolini way)
and this light female way of imposing stuff (Sher way).

The young guy was actually excited by Sher and not by art.
And the old lady who got to beleive all kind of stuff about Mussolini is a mirror example of being a fool.

Anyway the conclusion is that trashy art is as it is even if there are people who talk trash about it in the same way as that delusional lady talked about Mussolini.

---

One more thing about that contrast that is shown is that females ways win over some simple males in uniform multiple times.
I saw Belorussia events and there were females demonstations.
And this was cheered by different people like something valuable.
But of course it brought no result.

So there may be some "disinformation" in this.
Although one does not normally apply such standard of informativeness to the movie it is said to be based on autobiography so that needs more checking just in case.

Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock.
Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.

Some theories on what happened:
- Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash
- stock offering
- profit fixation on the main session

A lot of hamsters (including me) who missed the tesla hype expected the SPCE to became the new one.
And I beleive that accounted for bigger than normal swings.

It was interesting time in russian virgin-sect random trading circles.
Fun quote: "So 20% up by the night is a side movement for you?"
This quote made me realize that you cannot ignore that and not fix it even if you wish for some other mark.

Overall everybody is so negative about the stock movement now that I cannot dismiss it for sure.

Anyway I still love the news-orientedness of the stock and can't wait for something new and cool my the company.

So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.

First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks.
And I holded them.
Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.

Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold.
And missed some good actual run from that point.

Then in november or december I was in cash waiting for crash :).
Got some long-term SPCE position because of the new frontier and possible future value of high-technology used there.
Also I tried some dividend stocks at the time.

Then by comparing what didivend stocks provide to what SPCE jumps do I got totally converted into growth stocks overall and SPCE specifically.

Then I just bought and hodled.
So until this time I missed three good peaks and yesterday I sold not at the peak but at a rational price anyway.

TLDR my path:
- holding -> fixing
- fixing -> holding :)
- hodling -> fixing, not being married to a stock, rational approach

Or another angle:
- dividends idea felt good (laziest thing in the world) -> growth stocks are the thing
- married-hodling a paper for gainz -> rational measured approach (incremental, not lazy, requires further reading and execution)

Also right now it is not about depo size but individual gains size.

Anyway as a programmer I have some nice ideas too so the whole thing looks exciting.

Got some cool ride in all directions from SPCE recently.

So I got alot of not-easily to reconcile experience that is not cheep also.


Anyway gotta write some my levelup thoughts so I remember them better.

1. Unexpected stuff happens at any time and in any combinations. Gotta learn and be ready (chosen strategy) from the decision point.
1. it is about strategy choice from options and then appropriate execution plan and execution and not about any price moves at all
1. margin is a wild thingy, I'm not used to that now but gotta improve :) also one should be able to ignore price movements and forget about the account money (and potentially have more cash to compensate for it if negative news coming-out)
1. intraday requires back-testing and knowledge of probabilities and stop-loss distance is a crucial part of it
   and actualy automated system I think (so is not really an option outside of some obvious "rockets")
1. other than intraday holding without margin is easy thing to do but take profits should be automated
1. entry also should be distributed over a period where you want to flatten price movements and completely ignore them
1. manipulations or unexpected stuff happens so one cannot be unprepared to anything
1. if you watch at the price charts forget ease and comfort irregardless of where the price goes
1. it is like a work - you need to be on time on crucial points and be ready (also timeboxed decision making, not random urgent stupid actions)
1. in a way being serious and methodical works I beleive but also being open-minded for unexpected stuff is a necessary part of it! Because otherwise you are easily manipulated and predicted as the rest of the crowd.
1. deciding exit goal and exit points before putting a trade
   and deciding on entry process relaxes you thinking alot.
1. fresh and not confused brains are a resource - don't overtrade
1. any sign of lack of self-control is a sign of confused brains so access ot investments should be closed at that time!
  (like impulsive buying idea or other indulgent state of mind)
1. read books on stuff - they give useful small related advices
1. Don't listen to anybody - even if they are right today it is unbeliveably foolish to act on something outside of your understanding
1. But don't be disconnected from actual news and don't miss the first hour when they play-out in case you use margin for sure
1. The best way to use margin is to close it scalp/speculatively I think
1. The easiest and profitable thing too is to just make nice bets that have to be automatically fulfilled on money you can forget that exists without use of margin.
  (I still am not good at margin I beleive it can be used in an uptrend to buy corrections, temporaly maybe, but then you can enter some odd-decisions area that I honestly don't want to get experienced at but I feel like I need to get the experience to not have a fear of it. So buying on margin adds complexity for me at this point)
1. diary or just a sticker card planning of your investment and its outcome and exit points is necessary, also some justification of why it looks like a good investment and why risks can be "ignored".
1. hamsters loose on any movement of the price either up or down so for them it is best to avoid following it at all

You always "loose" somethnig. If not money then opportunities.
So it is not "easy".

Also very rare opportunities works but require stable mind-set.
So when on russian session MM decides to take-off stop-losses and moves price down it is easy money right there if you care enough to put an order and buy!

Overall there is something characteristic about this experience for me.
I feel like it really is about being badass in a way, being in a very clear non-emotional state.
I respect that and want to be part of it.

Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli.
Not in one session on one hand.
But on the other hand the second session was
something different and very fresh for me.

Alot of times the picture just looks well.
I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.

In school I didn't read stuff.
They forced stuff on us and it didn't work for me.
After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that.
Altohugh of course considering how the exerience is made overall -- not sure if my imagination is going to construct it better from paper.

But yeah - subjectively it is something both well-done and firm yet fresh.

Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception.
I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try.
So this post is about that experience.

## Positives

I'll start with positives to not be too harsh.

The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially.
There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed.

## Negatives

Well.
It looks like they tried to put all modern movie cliches there and were harsh enough on actors and viewers to also amplify them.
And given already amplified to the limit corny scenes they also added music to amplify and absurdize that even more.
The musician was abused at many points. I refuse to beleive that Nolan was making decisions.

There was one scene (first attachment to the ship) that as I noticed also looked absurd.

Cliches:
- crying males or in otherwise weak position and then also self-sacraficing
- above average sharp females that before you know throw tantrums and try to control males
- relations between genders, parent-children and things like that

Sometimes I felt that they repeat stuff twice and being too explicit like the target audience is not expected to understand anything.
But since I was rewatching it I can't be sure to evaluate that.

One more thing was that even though I liked some visuals I still somehow found at other times it to be a bit underperforming compared to my expectations.
Strange thing, because I don't beleive that just by passing 7 years the visual side can get outdated.
And I don't normally watch sci-fi to compare.

## Overall

Some nice things are there.
But considering all the annoying stuff they took into space and put in your face.
That likely ruined the experience for many.
For example than adventure/exploration experience I didn't feel in the movie (but maybe becouse of it was a rewatch).

More objectively speaking the movie is down to earth even though it brings situations in space to reveal things to people.

So I may conseder rewatching Gravity to get what I wanted.
That one even though it has some of that should overall be more detached and therefore more in the space.
No idea about timing though because today I watch Unity22 launch only.

## Nolan

So here is an excerpt of my older post that touches Nolan.

~~~
Concerning Nolan.
I first thought that he is getting old with his Tenet having stamps and otherwise annoying scenes.
Even though I liked ideas and realization and the key scenes of course are my kind of content.
Then I went for Inception to have a comparsion and that annoyance was still there (and appreciation of the good content) so it is not Nolan
who is getting older :).
~~~

After watching/rewatching 3 of his movies I found everything to be annoying to a different extend.
It is surprising to find that Nolan was so bad on these modern cheesy cliches.

---

One more thing about the movie - after watching it that Murphy law played-out like multiple times for me.
Interesting stuff.

Watched the movie.
It seems more balanced than Interstellar.
It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that).
But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.

It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.

It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological.
Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense.
But later she does redefines herself against memory and negative experience in a positive sense.

I liked it in the end even though in the beginning that childish behavior of Lara was too conspicuous.
I guess some people can't see the movie without being focused on all inconsistencies to laws of physics of the action.
But I think it is like in any art -- you bend the rules enough to be able to show what you want to show.

Also it is not only more balanced and less cliche that Interstellar.
But also it seems to be deeper and more unified yet faceted if you ask me.

It is just more convincing because it has less noise and complexity of the story I think.

Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant
I can't be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it's pillars.

One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes.
Modern way is to call it oppression.
Everybody loves new words.

And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his "followers" who established that soviet union rule here should be liars
and anything they say must be deception.

But the strange thing is that probably the guy himself had some ideas.

And surely not the nonsense they jiggle before the crowd these days.
But stuff like classes gets to be more real for me every day.

It is like I was so blind in my universalism but now it seems so evident.

So I'm convinced that classes are real.
And the step two is that class-warfare is real too.

In a way this realization simplifies alot.
It shows you who is who and why they act that way.

And by simplification in makes you calm and focused.

---

Fun fact. I got the idea and the post idea while watching "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" that is more exalted and not like this warfare stuff at all.
Of course actually I got to see that alot to finally collect the pattern so it is previous experience that contributed to the post more.
But maybe the movie in its exaltedness contrasted that somehow and made it more evident.

---

Another note: if dog acts like it protects the house with no strong exeptions then it protects the house irregardless of its "thinking".
So even if say some biological class does not wage war consciously there is no need to have consciousness at all.
Just acting like that is enough.

---

One example that I think is relevant.
When the investor Chamath was asked about Tesla.
He said something that made him look either foolish or deceptive.
He said something about people who are against Tesla just don't like the style of Musk...

From straight forward point of view that kind of stuff you tell to fools.
But who tells it must be one too or just pretending to be one.
But then smart above some threshould person would not embarass himself like that so there may be a better interpretation.

If one looks at it from class warfare point of view then it looks more interesitng.
He basically tells that we will win and it does not matter what you think about it.
Simply that.

And the crowd really like that kind of language whether they consciously understand or not why.

I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.

It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images.
As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision.
And it was compelling in some way to me.

I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too.
So the director says that the beauty and more superficial/temporal is there to be put to use and reaped somehow.
I didn't really understand the idea deep but the sequence was too obvious.

In a way the situation when the father wants to have his son tried resembles Euthyphro and possibly associates Socrates.

---

Also interestingly the main character actions can be interpreted differently:
- actually being this exalted and idealistic, willing to just make what is good by his own hands (he may see it this way)
- revenge against his parents (parents may see it this way)
- acheiving status by alternative means (powerful may see it this way)

It looks like get levelups and paid-for lessons from the marked every day.

Gotta write my thoughts somewhere so this place seems fit for that.

So I possibly see what is the difference between a complete "hamster" and a bit more strategic let's say "hunter".

Hamster has a very short information window and that makes the thinking impossible so he acts with lizard brain (so looses money).
Also random tips or even other hamsters "thinking" and stuff that is not understandeable as price movement in the moment itself is also not a food for advanced brain so it shrinks its involvement I think and causes what it casuses.

Hunter just has bigger overview and knowledge of the terrain.
So he has traps here and there at fovourable levels.
When he sees some cool landscape maybe he is astonished but he acts within the system that is understandeable and is tested.
That is where higher brain works.

The one by Zeffirelli.
Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.

The first impression is what is called "Tube sound" in Russia at least.
So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case.
After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive
it is quality of the movie too.
It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy.

Then comedy and wild story aspect got me interested to the middle of the movie.

And the end of the movie is something interesting because how unusual it is.
Also probably many people get offended.
So additionally the movie can be called controversial and experimental art too.

One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was.
First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background.
Now I decided to try another one and you guess what.
It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits.
Then it contrasts it by some piano notes.
But anyway I have no idea what to think about that.

Concerning the movie. It shows that it is a different movie right from the first scenes (if we ignore that credits occurance).
It immediately starts talking to you with images and jestures.

I loved the absurd scenes, I found them to be extremely fun.
So it is definetly my kind of movie.

Some impressive shots and atmospheric sequences of course.
Rewatch value.

Notable symbols:
- vase/lamp
- propeller/fan
- fences (possible chain too)
- movement: folliage, water

I assume water flowing away in the end means ending and that ugly sound is how empty barrel sounds.

---

Definetly rewatch value is there.

Just random thoughts:
- vase - initially I thought about pregnancy, maybe just emptiness overall?
- fans - noisy meaninless perpetual movement that changes nothing? while plane is expectation of something else maybe (possibly Antonioni reuses symbols of own or tradition)
- fat statue (again pregnancy?)

So yesterday was the flight and I wanted to put some obvious observations here and mostly comparsion with Virgin Galactic flight about a week ago.

I only go from comparsion point of view because it makes it easy.

So first striking difference was that VG used Mr. Colbert to host the show while BO had some way more serious most of the time.

Altohugh I must say that one comic thing BO show host was doing repeatedly is reminding about Karman line in different ways and one time she even instantly followed Karman line remark with big windows remark.

Anyway BO show was more serious while VG was more chill in aspects like the host choice, gifts choice.

Also another striking moment was that VG show was very personal and individualistic and Mr. Branson was the center of it.
Which was cool and I beleive shows the Virgin approach or Mr. Bransons approach to it - it is for individuals to go for it and they are at the center.

While BO show was more about technology and impersonal and gaining some serious professional-look points.

BO has not shown videos from the inside of the capsule.
I bet many things went not as planned.
Right now I assume they tried to force people to do stuff for camera and things went in unplanned ways.
So they loose some points on being too serious here.

*UPD: got to see the video from the inside from non-official source, it is ok, at this point I already made my opinion anyway. They released it during post-flight press conference that I didn't watch, it looks like it was alot of conventional talking with conventional these days piano notes playing here and there in between.*

I like the michievous acheiving spirit of VG founder I hope that his event and the spirit will help and shape experience there.
Also I respect technological acheivement of BO with all cool options it opens there.

Another striking comparsion is that BO looks more extreme. While VG looks more comfortable.

I beleive this more-extreme-event vs more-comfortable and more-available event is going to be the key between choosing one of providers in the near-term.
Even though they both have enough of both aspects.

In the old times hunters used to skin animals and sell the result.

These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor.

I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.

I definetly liked some scenes most notably driving throug fog.

There are some obvious things directors do:
- in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds
  (so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works)
- in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette
- you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life
- the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers
- some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?)
- some sounds are distorted in a way that seems like substances are at play but also I somehow associated them with flying still and later when the rain sound is distorted that way it seems more like some natural distortion that humans experience through life
- obviousness of some things raises suspicion

I think one should process visuals and speech in parallel to be able to notice most of the things directors do.

Maybe there is more that the second watch should show but I'm not sure if this one will attract me again at some point.
The only "negative" thing about it is that I felt it is really slow for some reason.

I liked a lot of visuals for unknown to me reason.
I start to be suspicious that I'm easy to impress visually.

Interestingly one translation to Russian of words of the director is so wildly different from another.
No idea if the original text is so ambiguous and is not in english or if some Russian translator got so creative.

I liked the movie. I liked the theme at the end.

---

Even though I really liked some scenes I want to add that there is some after-feeling.
Sometimes when some content is made to be accessible it just is too obvious.
And I feel like that other directors or whoever else's footprints are there and some authenticity may be lost.
Even though I'm just starting with Antonioni I'm suspicious about explicidness in this one.
Also this was the last movie where he was one of directors so there is objective basis for this kind of thinking.

Since I'm exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.

I bet there are good scientific theories but I'm too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:
- social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them
- hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats
- maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not

Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.

Anyway visually I'm just too easy to impress so I liked many "shots".

There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.

I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode...

---

On the next day after watching my thinking is like this:
- there are memorable scenes that are not as simple as the first reaction may assume
- There are tools the director uses that you notice at some points. And because the pace of the picture is so measured, the tools look more explicitly. And that asks for more analysis from the start of the movie of when they were used and what other tools of the class were used also!
- That pace on one hand makes viewers to pay attention to things that would be ignored othewise, on the other hand it probably requires timeboxed watching. And that attention to detials will demand a second watch with a pencil and probably in even smaller pieces.

Anyway on the next day after watching I beleive that rewatch is necessary.

# Approach

So I'm excited about my third approach of the market.
It is different from the previous ones.

The latest thinking is that margin is by default is not going to be used at all.

I have an interesting idea to start with "paper-trading" and then introduce cash gradually (with randomness actually to even not know the size of the position first to be more chill). Actual paper-trading should address the greed to jump into the last wagon and be more chill. Same thing with margin - it alters decision making so it has to be avoided for sure and way-way later introduced only gradually with randomness because otherwise it is a sign of greed - what is a costly state of mind for sure (as almost any other alteration I assume).

Also there are ideas for some cool indicators and automation related to stop-loss because the current tool does not have that the way I want. Execution is so key I'm sure about that.

# Dollar in the money!

There is this wild TraderTV Live show. I mean there is something to it and I don't know what.
Watching a bit of it here and there gives me ideas so it is useful to see an example if you haven't seen it somewhere else.
Also it is very positive on its own.

The phrase "dollar in the money!" I hear in the show itself seems like something arbitrary but it actually is more than that.

Also I'm reading a "trilogy" about trading.
It seems like some medieval magic with animals and all that, but hey, without that crazy basics and language knowledge you are on your own to create own language and notions - and that probably is there at some experience level but I assume one should start early with just-paper and with any kind of language to be able to iterate on your approach and tools and to get to see rare events that are great opportunities so that you can spot them the next time!

So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don't have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.

Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between.
I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I'm here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place.

So I thought it is cool to have a city existing only in dreams.
I bet architectors and people who exercise their spatial abilities have very cool ones.

In the morning some recognizable but unknown piano melody was returning to me.
Now I can't be sure if it was not constructed also.

There are more unique and different enough to be recognizable types of places. Some meaning resembling real-world but modified by previous dreams is attached to these places.

I think reading fiction or even descriptive nonfiction (I should definetly check for that genre) should also give some more construction blocks for the city.

I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.

They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
- clean background and possibly interesting lightening
- very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!)
- modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness)
- made in multiple shots
- narrative is delivered from this device that runs text
- narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands
- narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material...

The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there.
But I can forgive them not having that because you can't have so many melodies for every course and then they will start to noticably repeat...

And given that all I also am subscribed to this trading show and have seen one inteview of one CEO there.
So the CEO wasn't looking like those coaches: all-smiling / polished-looking or otherwise styled / etc.
So one can see none of that stuff and he is more "real-world".

And then they have shown the stock chart adjacent to his face too...
Continuing 2020+ pandemic is treating their stock price badly.
It may be too late to short but who know - people with FOMO could jump right-in (just kidding :).

Anyway Later they shown marketing forecast charts to kind of correct the initial impression.

I say imperfection makes it interesting!

I'm more attracted by realness but anyway first I'll try more of those courses to have more complete impression because who knows.

Updated thoughts.

There are courses where you have everything:
- performers know what they do
- visual design is definetly there
- content is to the point

And there are these:
- performers are forced to do what they obviously are not able to do
- visually things compete for being more stained with each other
- very superficial yet diluded content

In the first case you get to learn more then is explicitly said.
In the second case you are training your patience at best or a fool at worst.

And in this case I obviously go for higher quality.
What I meant by more raw and real-world is also quality but it is different.

When I see low quality almost by intent on a platform with stuff that also has content that respects some standards I don't know what to think.

A bad product is a bad product.
Is there a paid feature to remove all the lower quality stuff?

Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say...
I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas...

I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.

Pros:
- Some nice shots are present
- Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there

Cons:
- pace is not for me
- messy so called "psychological" stuff about characters
  being unhappy and all that does not attract me
- ugly sounds play from time to time

Notables:
- very obvious contrast of old person looking into a cup vs young people looking into skies but no idea where to attach that
- the male character is so out of place, no idea what to think about that

So I'll switch back to Zefirelli for something more lively.

---

One thing I should say that these directors they have very good shots there.
I bet it is because directors think about such nice shots first and then fill-out the rest.
So for people who can't handle the pace and lack of entertainment I bet this kind of content can be condensed into very stylish comicses.

Watched this one in two sessions and the decision worked well.
Because about the first session I got the impression that the movie is too much into this suffering thing.
And that I'm not the right audience for the theme overall.
And it surely has those aspects but there are more interesting things and ideas going on.

During the second fresh session I immediately noticed nice directors work.
At one point he shot it like it is actually in the space above the planet. Very cool.

The movie is deeper than what it seems.
My impression is that the movie is construced in such way that strong memorable images deliver you deeper story.
And it is not one sided so you have some unresolveable core there.

One aspect is that the movie shows that people who have no access to information make bad decisions.
And it is unlikely to be about modern times because information is so available.
But one can see how in older times higher classes used religion to contain lesser classes like that stepmother contained a competitor with her daughters.

More relevant to modern days would be use of ideology.
And how possibly higher classes control lower ones with it.
And that is more possibly because ideologies operate in some odd notions spaces where there is not much of accumulated real-world information.
When you create notions and then teach others stuff about these notions in such way that they change meaning whenever you need.
You probably are doing the same to vulnerable to that people.

It may look like a digression and probably it is.
But I surely think that the movie is about classes and how they interact.

It is also about personal feelings and fears.
The movie shows a lot of cages and fences.
Zeffirelli leaves no second option about how to feel about them.
He shows that they are made not only from ignorance but more importantly from own fear.

I have noticed that watching in two sessions worked for me well with two Zeffirelli movies (Sparrow, Hamlet).

It can be either due to the way he made movies or due to the way at least my attention works.

Currently I lean to the second option and I also think that this half-watch experience provides
similar value as rewatching: more details or connections are being noticed.

I think that it works this way:
- to know the range of emotions to be expected during the second session
  one is not overwhelmed by more obvious things and can pay more attention
- processing of new characters may take-up some thinking power during the first session
  but during the second one that resource is free

As a side note I feel like range knowledge is important not only to emotions to be expected but
also to tools the director uses.
Maybe here I'm looking at it not from a "consumer" point of view.

There are memorable pictures that are left from movies.
I think watching in sessions should faciliate stronger memory response.
And that should give more ideas at the next day.

So the next logical step is to try to watch one Zeffirelli movie in three sessions to see if that delivers even more value.

There is one simple thing I remember from an art class in school days.
It can be summarized this way: I didn't beleive that a thing in dark background looks brighter.
And that unresolved question informed some my decisions later while experimenting with that.
But it is something that is still not resolved in a way.

Today while I was walking around the city there were three occasions when I just got kind of surprised by beauty of some view.
And in these occasions preceding view was very different and in a way contrasted to the next.

So I start to see some of the effect in practice.
And it requires active attention and is not given.

It seems seing some aspects of beauty kind of sets a standard that you use.
And then you try see other standards at less conspicuous levels.
And this is one of paths to explore the medium.

Threre is this blender-question related to apple hiring.

Initially I thought: "what a stupid question":
- amygdala stuff at the core
- incomplete and nonsensical context

So in abstract this question primes for stupidity.
Although in the context of hiring interview I assume that
primes for some creativity.

I have no idea if it is useful in the hiring context.
But in abstract it is like an ugly but educational toy.
Because it demonstrates how amygdala-driven decision making is not useful.
While on the contrary most conventional ways produce better ideas.

First, I watched it in three sessions as planned.

The beginning predictably left me not excited.
The movie provides some words to describe it: "too modern".
And the word "flat" came to my mind too.
No idea why.
I will figure-out one day: is it me or is it how they are made.

At the end of the first third you get to see some **development** and get intrigued by it.

The second part goes like a more positive part.
Where Callas is shown **at work**.
No story movement as it looks.

The third part gets to be interesting because it shows something deeper about the character on one hand.
And also teaches something I think.
The word used "integrity" maybe is what it is about.
And I'm not that good at english to correct the script.
But I think "**authentity**" is the word.

After watching I quickly skimmed through random scenes again.
And even that really quick review provided value.
I got to see that flowers are used meaningfully in the movie.

Overall the movie shows that **magical work** behind this dream producing mashine.
And I like that whether it is true or not.
Also I recognize that there is a theme of old stars and this movie takes its very well deserved place there.

I've found that journallist woman character is very likeable.

Also the movie shows zoomed faces on the screen :).
Normally this is not what I'm used to and I always shake my head when I see they do faces full-screen in average movies especially.
In this movie I was less critical and because I knew that the director is not a fool I paid attention to what is being shown.
Also I had this idea to start drawing faces just to get better at it and this movie have given me the idea to use good movies as a source for that.
I think it should be easier to choose a good shot. If you know that there is some context and directors work is there, that may make it easier to start because it may be more interesting even though less like a free interpretation.

I saw it before and it left vaguely positive memory.

Overall the picture is light, it is composed from losely tied scenes with some level of humour and absurdity.

I have enjoyed pleasant dialogues and the level of etiquette.

Also humour is low key but can be very fun. Original audio track is a must.

---

NOTE: some spoilers ahead

---

The movie should be rewatcheable because of how subtle the humour is.
One random phrase can be just so fun.

Or consider a bishop playing with a sickle and then demanding union rate, no more, no less.
That is both fun and is relevant too.
Because it is actually how quickly that kind changes their allegiances when times change.

And also interestingly that sickle scene can get even get another light on it for a second in view of future scenes.

Also that chairs scene can be viewed in different perspective.
And I like that.
I like this ambiguity yet rich food for interpretation.

And puzzles like that are not expected to be resolved while meeting them for the first time.
Yet this one has a very light atmosphere unlike the reference ones for me.
So probably I need some more exploration among that kind.

So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.

Abstract:
- time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events
- there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can't put your attention on it
- the space around us is what is actually persistent
  and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it
- active attention is what I mean in the post. It requires some more yet gratifies
- it can be bigger or smaller space and it produces it's own value

I feel like making an argument that continuity of self is
created by continuity of space around us.
And therefore architecture, trees and other environment are actually living parts of individuals that live there.

Likely this is not a new argument.

But for me the deeper understanding goes in other direction and it is way simpler too.
It is that the act of giving attention to actual space is what produces living of an individual.

There is an interesting for me kind of posts where I explore near some more practical idea and that idea by itself may be only lightly implied or touched.
Or I go on some random tangent and the case that got me writing is completely ignored.

In this one the tangent is that contextless things imply reactive behavior.

So I think that goal of advertisments for exapmle is to distract a person into situation for which the subject does not have the context ready.
This way they are more reactive and will spend more attention while they construct relevant context.

And probably trashy art is like that too.
So it is watcheable only because peoples brains need some initial time to figure out what is going on.
And then the best case scenario is that process of constructing of that context is what may get interesting.

The more manipulative aspect of art and advertisement is to extract certain state of mind by providing own context that implies that for the subject.
No idea how that is called in practice, at some point I will read on that.

Anyway I like the idea of minimal necessary context.
So given any situation certain minimum has to be established so that it is always clearly actable on.

Also this is not the first time that I feel my posts just follow Nolan's movies.
So maybe it is a time to rewatch something.
Memento seems contextless enough for the occasion.
On the other hand I do not remember it as rewatcheable even though I have a feeling that I watched it not once.

Initially I thought that "extremely funny nonsense" describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.

But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive.
So that it may require some tools to weave that.
Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that.

Another observation is that at least once directors used repetition and then pause to highlight something.
And there was less obvious but very funny aspect of the scene to highlight.
Also I remember that Zeffirelli once used a bit outstanding event that did not advance the story. And I thought that he used that just to highlight one symbol used there.

So this movie confirmed me thinking in terms of markers to highlight and request addittional attention to something.

Post-soviet land has it's own charm and peculiarities.
One of these is propaganda.

Today I noticed something.
Imagine hearing talk about war atrocities of your ideological opponents in a kind of whispering way from the TV.

This kind of content, even if dirty, still can make one proud of local acheivements in propaganda.

Western propaganda that I'm exposed to is not of a good taste for me.
I cannot enjoy the cheap way it is delivered.
They have a long path before them to develop that.

Although objectively my exposure may be limited.
So I'd like to see the best exemplars from there too.

Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.

Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art.
And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward.
This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.

I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely.
Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does.

So it is a pursuit or exploration of eternal.
Is there a strongest bind?

---

While writing it I remembered what other stuff is there.
Like art being attached to status on one hand.
And on the other hand for example they put a statue of shit in Moscow recently.
And there are those who destroy arts.
So I guess humans foolishness competes to be called eternal too.

For example at any point one can move the attention to say creative stage background that is a mess too.
It looks like somebodies experiments but it offers a light puzzle-like content to check at any point.
Also the host does his job very well.

Anyway the idea of german quality is one thing that contributed to me starting learning it so I choose content appropriately.

Usually I'm not big into reading and reading newspapers.
But a couple days ago I stumbled upon one article.
Actually the article won the competition among other headers first.
Then I just got to like the rich tools used in the content.
Basically the article got me captured starting from the header.

And this is unusual for me.
So I checked the author.
She has only one another article there.
But there are many other books and articles in foreign media too.

First. Visually interesting without question.
I also liked characters there.
Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.

The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze.
And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.

There is this word "soviet intelligent-sy".
It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time.
And I hear this from time to time that conformists are intelligent because it is expedient thing to be doing.

The conformist in the movie is always out of place.
And often being powerless and weak for that reason.
So that smart but weak is one conflicting contradition.

And if we ignore the weak-criminal conformist presented in the movie.
More moderate versions of conformists must have some big numbers.

There was the old study with people applying current to others under supervision and they have shown high conformance so maybe the majority of population is the right measure.

Found-out that scribd has some good stuff that I wanted to check like this title.
So I got over first three chapters in audio format.
Looking at how it goes I would switch to the short version in this case.

1. Don't eat while listening to it because the author does alot of stuff in the beginning for sure. I think consciously but  who knows;
1. Even though narrated by the author the experience is very copy-paste/so-conventional from the execution point of view. No idea why;
1. Also the author talks like he talks to children. I know that he is a professor. I'm curious if he gives lectures and it is a thing to talk like that in education there. Also he is a professor of psychology - maybe that has specifics;
1. Also the premise that author argues in the first three chapters is that reason just follows intuition and author actually is guided by that idea in how he presents the argument. So that childish aspect is very obvious;
1. The second chapter ends in apotheosis of nonsense (I hope) with the promise to be reasonable in the next chapter. It continues where it stopped;
1. One negative thing with the approach to "manipulate" reader first is that the author primes some readers to distrust from the start which is a fun way to start;
1. Also the guy could teach a monkey with his premise because he repeats it so often that it feels like you are reading Allen Carr again;

Makes you think that nonsensical packaging these days is like some funny excess clothes back in a day.
But actually the right thing to do is to go straight after the relevant papers.

NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.

I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.

- like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots
- also some interesting shots overall
- there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions
- like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going
- I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too
- unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial)
- in that "surrounding" Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad
- and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist

Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea.

---

The second session started with a dialog that got me initially to loose interest so I postproned watching for a week.

But on the next attempt I was exposed to death because of the continued pandemic.
And that made part of the dialog more undestandeable from the point of what the director wanted to show there.

Then the first grown Jesus appearance was a well done challenge for the director too.
He showed authority without external stuff like what John or Herod project.
Also interestingly the director left two points where the viewer can see that Jesus almost communicates to John about future events: when John reflects on it and when later disciples talk with Jesus about the event.

I should mention that I was distracted from time to time so I got to rewind it not once.
Once I noticed a nice couple of seconds scene that has more meaning if you rewind and know what follows next.
Also there was a scene with many people and those kind of distract me because you don't know yet who is relevant. So rewatch value may be "hidden" not only in small preceeding scenes but in such crowded scenes that you can analyze better when you know what follows.

Anyway I loved the second episode.
Lots of visual meals.
As always vicious ones have the most interesting scenes IMO.
To the end of the episode Judah is being introduced.
Since I don't know the details of the plot I'm getting intrigued what kind of meals will the chef serve next :).

---

Meals presented were different ones as expected.
Sometimes a bit absurd for my simple view. For example miracles themselves are not something I can simply watch with my highly sensitive to any nonsense mind.
Some were big scenes.
Overall positive impression.

One thing that keeps my attention is this: "Behold: the kingdom of heaven is already there".
This quote if not altered by me is from the first episode but you hear it repeats.
And I have some posts here on me observing arts and then nature and I plan to add another one.
In short: if you just watch then you start to see more.
The sky can look spectaculary like the first time.
Then you see new glow of autumn colors.
Simle things get unexpectedly beautiful.

I mean it is not something unknown to humanity and is not what Jesus was saying.
But given I was not exposed to texts and traditions, my simple understanding is like that.

Anyway back to the movie.
I believe the concept of rock is mentioned twice before Peter is told to be the rock where the church should be founded.
That aspect of the rock was new to me. It is one of these things not told explicitly but it mentioned twice so it was quite obvious.
I also recently saw a verse mentioning stone while reading Faust and that made me puzzled so I was more sensitive to the image when I saw it in the movie twice.

Also having this visual fulcrum and "acquaintance" with characters almost makes you curious about other things about them.
I expect the next final episode to deliver on that remarkably.

---

The final part is less of a nice trip or a dinner.
So I won't judge from that point of view.
I'll just address what I found to be interesting.
Although I should say that the episode has lots of crying people kind of content.
Also it has content that makes you think about the religion.

But I'll focus on characters here.

Caiaphas has this top position and he is the only one who does acting like spiritual matters are more than letters and matters of power to him.
It looks unnatural by intent.
I beleive others are not allowed to use that degree of this kind of manipulative rhetoric.

Zerah is this very neutral and balanced in some way character just playing his role. Able but gray too.

Judah unlike Zerah got unbalanced. He was influenced by Jesus but remained undecided. He lost clear thought and action.

Pontius Pilate was guided what to do at every step.
The only able thing he did was avoidance of taking the decision by himself... I guess very valuable skill for such kind of officials.
But anyway interestingly the director showed through him that there is possibly danger of Jesus to Rome too.
I found this remarkable because actually there is a view that Christianity caused or at least contributed to the fall of Roman Empire.

---

Overall very interesting trip into Roman Judea with many interesting acquaintances.
Less likely to be a "social" movie.
Interesting introduction into the story about religion founding.
Possibly touching human nature.
Also provides a good image of Jesus for people who are curious about the religion.

The director shows this contrast between Jesus and Zerah.
One represents heart to the fullest and another - mind.
They have not really interacted with each other (first dialog at the temple I ignore for whatever reason).
The most direct interaction I beleve was standing against each other at the end of the "trial".
Zerah entering the empty tomb is something bearing the same meaning.

I watched some of it.
I'll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.

# Other

The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.

The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure.
(I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn't really live through that time. But probably like here in Russia people still affected and see communism stuff even if they haven't actually lived through it)

There are other parts that are more like cold documentary that document some old places that look like there was a nuclear blast.

And one part has stuff like new stadiums and electronic music - the stuff was new at that time but this makes it look cheap and irrelevant for the modern viewer.

I don't know who allowed one of those no-name directors there.
But that director just randomly shows you ugly stuff with annoying sounds on the background.
I guess this stuff was called experimental art of the time or so.

I should say that given all errors they commited there I still like that "diversity of errors" - they all are understandeable.
In that sense the movie having these different questionable parts still gives food for thought.
Especially if you have the good part there too to contrast them all.

# Worthy

The part by Zeffirelli is something one cannot miss.

Preceeding directors moved the bar so low that I started to think that it is me being sick at the moment is what is making me so critical.
And then I decided to just write a realy nasty post on them so I continued watching just because of this.

But Zeffirelli moved the bar to its highest so I rewatched and started writing the post.

In short:
- The director is very visual as always;
- The music is beautiful and elevating;
- There is meaning;
- But it is not cast in stone. It is interactive: you are provided with a light puzzle, an open question, but not with some pre-cooked thing.
  If you see multiple interpretations - rewatching provides you with more keys;

It starts with almost black and white hazy scene of playful florentines.
They cast long shadows on the mist.
The ball enters the scene from a side and they play with it.
There is a moment when the moon is visible behind one of them.

They kick the ball into the future where youth play with it and a priest is shown to be favorable of them.

While different generations play with the ball you meet high cultural acheivements of florentians.

Later things change and the game gets messy.
To the end you see fighting and flying sand resembles mist at the start.

And the ball is taken from them by gods as it was given to them too.

You see the good quality there.
There is class I believe too.

One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I'm used to capture but it is definetly visible.

The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.

Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish.
At some points you may think: "What kind of dialogs are these?".
You already know what is being said but they still dictate own pace.

On one hand the topic may dictate that pace so that there is room for thinking.
On the other hand the main character may seem older because of that at some points.
Even though he is sharp at other points.
So maybe it is like how the experience looks from the inside.
You are not entirely sure in a way.

There is certain optimism and kind of human greatness in that the guy like the main character
is so experienced that he even thought a spirit a thing or two.

I have just returned from a walk.
On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing.
I tried to look at it and wasn't able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow.
So these "golden-hats" the church has make it possible to see it even further.
I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.

There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays.
It is complaining-type propaganda on the TV talking about the west for sure.

They have money and certain ugly-type creativity so you get to see interesting stuff.

For example in one show they have one light source in the frame: behind the talking head sitting behind the table and leaning forward.
So it resembles some kind of old-school interrogation with a lamp in your face where all viewers are in that position.
I assume soviet people like that kind of stuff in the more modern setting.

Today the propaganda complaining about the west item was guns in the US.
Given the crime stats here one would assume they should not talk about things like that.

So you can't teach somebody how to make cookies when your are incapable of making your own.
(This odd example I took from a random youtube writer)

But no. In propaganda as in the real life rules are different.

- Plumbers teach making cookies.
- Painters complain about laws.
- Lawyers talk about pets.

I believe there is some kind of absurd aesthetics to it.
I guess I need to watch some absurd comedy because it has more to reality than what I'm used to lately.

I believe local propaganda may have opened a new layer of perspective for me when I watch conventional stuff.
But I probably don't have enough attention already while watching stuff.
To also capture that second-level absurd is just like another tool I'll check/see from time to time.

Watched it without subtitles or anything.
Actually didn't even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.

Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand.
I'm repulced by the ending of Lakme for example.
Some things should not be played because they can't be played truthfully I believe.
But probably I'm getting to be more open minded about the genre.

This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well.
Maybe because there was no speech and I tried to understand things so I payed more attention.
Also since I was free from verbal processing I watched from the point of a director in a way.
I payed more attention to gestures and their meaning.

Also I normally don't know how to understand vocal.
But maybe recent listening to Callas and different operettas has altered that.
So I enjoyed initial aria by Domingo and I definetly relistened one part by Obrazcova.

Side note. Lately I try to surround myself more with well-placed voice.
I got one cool idea about that but probably audio-books are the way.
I just need to organize my routine to have that reliably.

Back to the main part. One aspect I found interesting about the picture is that it is likeable dispite being a tragedy.
It applies to empathy all the time in different ways but it still I believe has a class.
Maybe this is just the name of the director that alters my view in such way.
Maybe it is me being so detached because of lack of verbal information.
Or maybe I need to figure-out what else is there.

One thing I should add is that I'm curious if there is alternative realization of the opera with more sicilian character of the Santuzza. That should be interesting to see too.

Watched this one without knowledge of libretto and without understanding of language and that was not the best idea.

Visually and overall I'm attracted to the topic of such strange wandering performers.
But as very often happens - you get the shape but there is something else joined to it and you don't get enough of the thing you expected initially.
So one may think that the first thing was there just to
create an illusion of something new.

Anyway actually it was not only for an illusion as I saw as able to hear and see without knowledge of italian.

But anyway I don't think that two topics so different are so easily joinable.

Anyway I liked most of the content in more visual way initially.
Then I went to read libretto and got astonished a bit more.
There is value in watching in more orderly manner than I did.

Also during the visual part I sometimes saw that it is almost like a good time to have a photo.
Not that the content was so "spectacular" to put that into the frame as far as I understand.
But I got to believe that the director planned for certain pace of memorable-enough frames when he constructed the picture.

You see quality from the start.
A movie about life and play that says it for itself.

From the director tools point of view I have noticed that the director conveys some things before actualy revealing them.
So there is a rewatch value added just by that.

Also some scenes are spectacular for unknown reasons - this must have been studied well already.
But that I think is not what plain rewatch helps with. Only if it is timed well after other high quality content to compare to.

Overall very enjoyable especially before it gets into "complex" matters.
Then it gets into something-else but also unique in it's own way.

I'd guess that the eight is females around him
And the half is himself.
Not sure about relatives yet they possibly are like a proxy or even casual to some extent.

Looking into Blues and got this series produced by Scorsese.
I liked Vinyl series so checking this too sounded like a good idea.
I watch it in the order of my own relevance/preference.

---

The part by Clint Eastwood got me interested from some unexpected angle.
Most of the time music itself did not attract me.
And that got me interested even more.

Possibly he tried to capture some of that atmosphere so brought those characters to convey it for themselves.

There is both individualism and yet certain communication and understanding.
Also I feel like certain simplicity, freedom and optimism are relevant words.
But I'm still divided on the music - gotta practice it more and see.

Clint Eastwood called it own American form of art and that is an interesting nut to crack.
I think I'm having something and simple explanations do not work here for me.

---

The part by Wim Wenders seems complex.

I liked how it started - with something that look very open and promising in my eyes.
Of course overexpectations are often unmet.
But it was an interesting part in its own way.

One aspect is about following certain characters stories.
Even though it is not a high-energy content.
I really like biographical content so surely I liked it here.

Then there is social-political aspect.
(These days "social-" is added everywhere so I felt like it fits there even though I'm not sure if the phrase is correct at the time)

My relation here is two-fold.
On one hand I understand the arts changing life for better aspect.
Very cool feeling and probably left deep marks in souls of those involved.

On the other hand there is certain purity of music that possibly is an illusion that I still harbor.
More specifically music by itself evokes something.
And that something is what actually gets me interested.
And any lyrics not to say some socio-political meaning I consider to be distraction from those images.
So I like what it evokes in abstract.
But then making movie about that would be risky or impossible.
And also sometimes it feels like this abstract magic could get dispelled.

I'm in the beginning and there is that feeling that I'm not going to be told anything organizational.
Because the book goes into details on peculiar stuff that is cool from another point of view.

He makes a picture of different obstacles there to find-out this and that.

This post is like a smell of a level-up of a kind.

For some time I wanted to write a post about where this simple writing experiment got me.
Surely interest in arts is involved too.

What got me to that idea is that everytime I go for a walk I see something new.
Something worth recording or trying to analyse in a post.
So there is plenty of simple-looking experiences
but in limited time non obvious how to approach in a contained way.

Whether the sky is a blast or mute.
Whether snow is blue, white, green or red.
Or fog.
Or maybe you meet a tree in the winter that is like fireworks.
Why the sunset is green?

Lots of posts remain frozen in the air.

I recall in Antonioni's movie that starts in the clouds in the final monogolue.
There is the idea that behind every directed picture there is another picture that is more true to reality.
And then there is more.

So I'm thinking that I need to record these observational posts at least in draft mode.
And then possibly compose pictures when the occasion is right.

Back in a day I liked heroes of might and magic game.
Overall it was not right to get me addicted but I really liked some parts.

One thing I found odd is that there are like ten types of dragons.
Most of them I considered to be nonsensical - created just to fill some gaps in ideas.

One particular kind of dragons I liked irrationally is the Skeleton Dragon that can be upgraded to the Ghost Dragon.
I liked it on one hand for no apparent reason.
But I found it odd that you upgrade a material thing to something ephemeral and that thing gets stronger.

Move forward 20 or so years.
And today I saw that kind of dragon in the sky.
I was Big. Kind of in the center above you.
Not a complete version but a convencing one with open jaws.
Then after a minute it disappeared because clouds got dissolved.

It looked more like a bone version but now I see the point why it is upgraded to the ghost version.
Also now it is apparent why in the game it has the lowest HP among dragons.

There are always visuals that I enjoy in Zeffirelli movies and I think it is just my taste being very simple in a way.
I'm not at the point where I can be specific about visual styles of directors.

The plot offers a streak of victories to the protagonist.

- First at La Scala when he gets a better opportinity where he is more valued;
- Second when he revives the diva;
- Third when he again exchanges the conventional success for the soulmate and a new undertaking;
- And then becomes a conductor too, saving and even altering the performance, making it feel more like a historic event;

I think one theme that goes through the movie is how new generation finds and takes it's place.
The name suggests that too. Maybe I should just read the list of all plots finally so I don't need to analyze but maybe something is lost then.

In the beginning the protagonist is being dismissed by the La Scala judges and it is their normal game as Rossi told him.
Then status difference is highlighted both by Nadina and the monarch.

The protagonist dismissed La Scala.
Conquered the diva and took her from the monarch.
While also helping to take the course of the country too.
And then went after establishing a non-profit in that emerging domain.

---

There is also emotional part of the movie where you see different female roles that played their part and succeeded too.

Also one thing I like to think about the plot is that Rossi has staged the story of young admirer returning the diva completely. Or maybe Arturo smartly made-up his story. Somehow I like to have an acceptable lie in this to keep it to the spirit of the scene.

**Spoilers Land**

The movie has multiple parts.
I accidentially started watching the one by Visconti that I had already seen at that point and got sucked-in.
And then to write more gave another look.
And then I could not resisit another look...

The setting is in the Alps.
Alot of botanical framed pictures everywhere represent the topic on the walls.
Lack of acquaintance with arts limits the viewer at different points...
Red color is favored there.
Some shots are very likeable.

After the first watch you are left with the dark feeling of that hard trade.
Life-continuaiton versus this brilliant illusion and play.

On the second watch I got questions:
- when she ordered gin there was emphasis - did she knew already at that point?
- when looking around and not finding - I'm not sure what was not found (she as everybody found the ring - there is something else)...
- anyway, surrounding - I felt like surrounding is so messed-up that if changing of direction was planned - the surrounding must had been changed first
- lower class of birth - that may be keeping her career choice - because how otherwise would she keep the level relative to more connected competitors? (represented by the odd jealous people in green and pink in the picture)

One fun aspect of the movie is her friend and her relatinship with own husband.
She messes with him so badly.
The protagonist messes with males for fun too but her way is exusable while her friends way is extremely comical.
Always not alone - distractions are plenty, and being witful the protagonist does what she does best - plays.

Maybe this signifies some genre change in the industry.
She and her friend play different genres.

One idea is that her magical attractiveness is because of that fire that actually can burn her.
So the name of the part is: Witch Burned Alive.

Also this more competitive aspect of the tradeoff restores the control of the protagonist so it is not some dark fall when something is lost as it may feel by the viewer.
But more like the dark journey and further rise for the "Witch".

This short-picture by Visconti ended up being a journey too.

Anyway I got dragged-in into it.
Normally I watch something different in the new year but now that place was empty and this picture just took that place and established itself.

**UPD:**

Of course it is so obvious what she was looking and wasn't able to find is to have what the hostess has.
That ring with brilliants means both that level of status and children.
I have not expected such a nice puzzle and a beautiful one too.
I bet there are gems to find in other Visconti movies that I watched only once.

There are limited choices in my habitat.
One example is that you can't get good slippers.
Like there is a fashion that dictates slippers to be always so small that the foot gets molded by them.

So at one point I found a pair with eastern design with noses up.
I bought the biggest pair and with the pattern that can be considired stylyzed dollar signs on all sides if one wants to see it that way.

Anyway one good idea I got recently is to do walking meditation thing.
When at older times I always was looking for a manual or detailed description for such activities.
These days I just use something alike to what is called common sense.

So I was doing the practice and I thought that
monks definetly don't it
the carpet + eastern-dollar-slippers way.

Anyway it works for me and is fun.

I have heard that there was this show ran by Oprah.
At that point I didn't know the language.
Now I don't watch shows.

But still somehow indirectly through environment I got this impression that if you got a really hard question and you don't know what to do then there is always Oprah to answer it.
And the final answer to any question is: Oprah knows.

Today the first time in my life google pointed me to oprah.com.
It is hard to imagine my excitement and confusion at the time.
Openinig the link will be like entering the live studio.
Am I ready for the answer?

Digital world incentives makes for some odd-looking entropy.

Things at one point can be quite good.
But then they don't grow in understandeable sense - they
may still have some reason to be attractive on one side
on another side they just devolve and get stupider and uglier
for no meaningful reason.

So you get this mixed bag.
And there is something like loss-aversion or switching cost.
Which I think is a costly intuition in these matters.

Anyway unsubscription a day keeps entropy away.

In Russian to cheer for the team can be directly translated into english as "to be ill for".

I found it amusing when a reporter from Olympics in China said that "We are still being ill here".

Also between that it is very patriotic to show
some soviet technological developments/acheivements that were not pursued after the fall.
So that people feel the dark sorrow for the glorious past
and resentment toward ideological enemies.

Anyway it would be cool to finaly have robots
competing in their own Olympics but somehow we don't see that.

I lean towards the side that
robots are so worthless that such olympics
would be laughable.

But also even if you have non-useless robots
then the next weak link is people and
they would make them a parody anyway.

Least bad scenario would be robots running in masks.
And of course you can make them swim in coca-cola or in ketchup.

This is not the first time I see this.
But I like it when I see how tools of craftsman are being used.
It makes things more understandable and more like communication.

So I liked how director emphasises certain places.
That anchor then can reappear in memory later while adding to the experience.
Or even offering small rewatch opportunity.

Also I liked how in one episode some theme from the preceeding one was confirmed.

And of course I have seen some new italian gesture.
Maybe it is time to start collecting and organizing them.

Anyway there is some good fun in the movie.

All episodes are unusual.
Creators were not afraid to do experiments yet not trying to cross lines.
I liked how they put a mafiozo into random guy's house in the first episode.

Anyway not episodes are comedy.
Multiple episodes appeal to compassion to a very different degree.
Yet even in stronger and darker ones at the surface there is still
something else going on that alters the picture.
And it tells you something.

Enjoyed the quality of course.
I'm just getting to know the director but the common language is present.

Recently I wrote that least bad scenario would be robots being made to run in masks.

But I didn't expect that people would do worse and voluntary.
That error of underestimating idiocy and comedy of real-life I should stop committing.

Anyway some of hokey players ended-up playing in masks.

At least now I know that the game is not as demanding physically and oxygen-wise as I thought.
But also everybody got entertained by this new equipment.

### Some Context

Got the bats flu the most recent stemm as it seems.
Charlie Chaplin was on my list to check - out.
So the opportunity to do that was realized.

Also Charlie Chaplin is such a phenomenon.
And there is this familiarity to his character that you develop.
So it feels totally ok to just use Charlie.


### City Lights

Touching story. Wery well played. Enjoyed the comedy.

Charlie had his own independent studio at the time of shooting.
And compared to the earliest short silent comedy that I have had an opportunity to check.
This definetly looks like more serios work.
Surely you get what is expected - extremely comical scenes.
And you get more variability because of length.
But you also get the main plot that makes it a real movie.
And there is something more I believe.
Maybe it is that you can alter the speed of the show
when you are not constrained by the short format.
And Charlie uses that option to have scenes of different pace.


### Earliest Works

And since I mentioned earliest - they may have something in them.
But later overall quality gets better.

One interesting thing is that even in silent comedy
they had managed to have an analog of laughing sound in the background.
Anyway that is what possibly made me to switch to look for another period and to City Lights.


### Other Info

One random detail about the movie is that the main actress
was angrily dismissed when the movie was almost finished.
It looks like the final stick was she trying to leave earlier because of her hairdresser appointment.

And another actres was tried but because the movie was so far in the development
the final decision was to return the first actress to finish the movie.

The 20 years old actress was not too sophisticated and that ended-up adding value.
Because of certain simplicity she provided.

It was also mentioned that Charlie worked under own schedule and
could focus and perfect scenes for some time.
It was said that the first meeting scene took 300+ takes.
So there is thought in the way things made.

# Heat

On one hand the topic is heated so it is not advised for polite discussion.
On the other hand there is some insight to extract.

# Naming

The scope of what is called "special operation" actually is nuclear.
One can say that it is an invasion or war - expecting the worse.
But also this can be something addittional to that - one move in some combination on the geopolicial landscape.
China is still to make the move. Iran may be interested too?
Who is next?

(UPD 18 March: China looks scared-enough by the example of sanctions so I'm
reluctant to believe they will do much at the point.
But there is no way I can understand how their thinking goes
and what their system produces.
Also as I understand now the genocide title is in play.
I guess there is nothing to add then.)

# Intro

I got the idea to write something on this from one less-pupular youtuber.
The video was not nonsensical and had a point about writing somethnig authentical.

Writing a rant is not what I do here. At least I try to have it a bit different.
I prefer to write too abstract stuff that tangently touches the more authentical point I wanted to touch.

So what can be said about such topic without bringing all the nonsense and rants?

- context can be looked into (to the extent of known)
- some story of how situation developed can be written (to the available knowledge extent)
- future scenarios are unpredictable but some aspects that looks relevant may be highlighted

# Abstract

There is not only a conflict on the ground but also a conflict in thinking too.
And it is this eternal situation.

On one hand if the conflict has got to this hot stage from humanetarean angle one should want it to finish sooner than later.
On another hand surely everybody is invested in own plans/stories and nobody wants to loose.
So stuff escalates and human-cost goes up for everybody.
I believe it is the prisoners dilemma.

# Scenario

Countries-wise:

- Russia is not in a strong position long-term demographically and economically - so time plays against it, so it has to be pragmatic
- Ukraine from the outside looks more politicised and in a more ideological way - if this is the case then it is not about time and more about ideals

Comparing countries officials tells the similar story:

- one is old-school, soviet-school, military-type
- another AFAIK is endaevorous artist but very successfull because got this high

So Russia (leadership) is pessimistic and endaevorous (because it plays against time).
And Ukraine looked to be more optimistic and endaevorous in it's own way.

Also western idealogues feeded into optimism and created fake sense of security for Ukraine.
Like in Russia the younger opposition also overreaches because they tend to believe stories they are told.

So there is this endaevorousness and unwillingness to cooperate at all.

But then the bats flu has happened (the flu stuff was a similar disaster to this stuff now but with its own spin).
The flu was paired with all kind of overreach by the state.
And inflation that was produced in the process has provided some new opportunities for endaevorous.

This changes the cost for Russia to invade. But stories Ukrainians are told do not reflect that change of the situation.
And Ukrainian leadership can't change their calculation and stories and continues doubling down on the outdated ones.

And then it happens.

---

**Deja Vu**

I have a deja vu feel like in the Chernobyl series when the reality change was so impossible to comprehend
by everybody and they all ignored it completely while things were getting only worse until it got unbearable.

And the bats flu in 2020 was a similar story actually.

---

I like having things as lists so:

1. context: both sides are endaevorous, complete difference and inability/unwillingness to find common language between leadership
1. bats flu (if it was caused by something then that could be added as a step before)
1. state overreach
1. inflation
1. western "sanctions" became less costly then NATO expansion (timer started to tick)
1. inability to adjust when you are invested into lofty stories of western support, officially ignoring proposal of non-expansion/security framework, some odd rhetoric about nuclear
1. invasion

# Ukraine President Personality

I don't follow the person and have no idea really but here is how it looked from the outsider.

From the start I perceived this as a disaster for him as a leader and a huge blow to the "democracy" that elected him.
Because you can't just loose the country and blame the other guy (this is not what presidents do AFAIK).
(UPD: I don't know if he personally did that but I have heard this blaming everywhere, probably because people think in personal-relations terms.
But alot of disinformation in general comes in these terms too so I just filter this out.)

But then he started to earn some of respect-points actually because he continued playing his role even though he got this very bad hand now.
But then possibly these videos were recorded in advance so everybody got fooled.
But the move is smart so he gets smart-points as a media personality anyway.

Also some decisions like giving-away guns freely are risky and desperate.
People will not be able to use them other then by selling illegally.
Also europe should have own problems already and new coming because of inflation and I don't think they also need having a spike in illegal guns availability.

There may be some idea behind it as a
deterrence against possible tyrany.
But that probably should have been done in way more organized fashion and way earlier.

Anyway future will judge all decision makers involved in that.

(UPD: I assume this was meant not for actual random people but
to show availability and to have stuff for more trained ones who would come later)
(Also there are vidoes of Arestovich talking directly with no BS
about this war happening a couple of years before it happened
so some preparation may be already there)

Anyway he started being interesting to me.
Because the situation does not leave good options.
So it is either a disaster or maybe actually some level-up opportunity.

# Psychology of the Observer

Long war is a huge cost to everybody involved so wanting that is what only third-party (enemy) can want.
So psychologically one can either want quick victory or one can want quick defeat while also switching sides.
Maybe there is a third position: relative win-win, that avoids huge loss-loss and is preferable because of that.
Logically the trigger to have this compromise should be visibility of that loss-loss.
But I don't see that now.
Anyway I need to get myself into game theory and history/geopolitics more to have some insight about what that could be.

As I understand people who protest may be psychologically playing the role of that loss-loss if they get a big-enough crowd.
Also they obviously may just think in civillian ethical norms and intuitions.
I don't really think they play the "switch" thing (outside of those doing actually crazy things but likely they are not smart).
No idea what is the right way to have "switch"/not-smart not being used by the third-party.

Anyway I considered people here as these biological robots but surely there may be individual reasons too.

# Future

I have no idea what actual situation will be.
Stuff is uncertain and it will get more uncertain during this uncertain year.

I tried writing some analysis but it is likely that it will get outdated every week.

# Propaganda

There is some high octane number propaganda out there.
On the state-owned channels one can hear more mushroom-type propaganda: keeping you in the dark and feeding emotionally charged crap.
But I know that there are independent bloggers who are just high-quality stuff.

You get maps. Short patriotic rants. And Ukrainian accent of the archorman.
And I definetly see that guy doing it well.
But also one can't surely say if he is being payed or just does it the way he likes.
Because those who are paid tend to be obvious and cheap in a sense.
I guess such independent ones (until realtion is demonstrated) you can't call propaganda even though official propoganda has a lot to learn from them.

Will see what UN will produce. I'd prefer to have truth and satellite evidence of whatever happens but I can't be sure about that.
I hope I'm surprised and they don't do rants and emotional manipulation and there is some useful information delivered.

Also the ammount of fakes/propaganda makes
me being pessimistic about
hearing any evidence-based truth at this point unfortunately.

Strngely official propagandists in Russia often are bald (only males I mean) and I don't know why.
Perhaps there is a secret club of bald people who control our media institutions?

# What I'd like to see

From the geopolitical point of view I'm certain that now both parties wants to have a reliable security framework.
(If that is possible at all.)
The interesting question here is whether NATO/US want that.

I hope when geopolical stuff is sorted there is no overreach on normal civilians.
Because then it can actually get ugly.
Also doing it right in the east of europe would unite everybody there so badly too.

But since you have to get at least provocations if not atrocities.
And both sides are giving opposite propaganda stories on that.
Then hopefuly available technology is used to document actual evidence more or less impartially.
Which seems like a high standard even though I believe the technology should be there for that.

# Ethics

Intuition says that initiating killing of people is terrible thing.

But evidently states operate in what can be called Machiavellian mode.

Probably there are some international norms
that tells what wars are just and such.
But the reality is messy and people don't know
this stuff anyway.
So they are left to intuitions and manipulations.

I'm not sure if completely avoiding ethical aspect of
such situations is ethical by itself.
But intuitions and manipulations are not my favorite input
for making judgements on such serious topics.

So I would like to approach this from some not-nonsensical international norms ground.
But I'm not competent in this.

And there is a huge class of professionals
who could explain well.
But easy/cheap stuff like manipulations and appeal
to intuitions or to the ideology is what is produced AFAIK.

Also if you can't enforce then there is no point in norms
so the problem is likely in the system
and how it failed in this case.
If that can be fixed then likely ethics
issue is prevented in the first place.

# Cost

I assume both sides see opportunities that are just too good.
So human price of what I assume is a good demographics will be paid.

Russia will get in trouble earlier and thus will not be the same.

I assume China sees some very good opportunities in this too but I have no idea about what will happen here at this point.

Anyway one have to be positive and hope for better.

# Calendar

One funny thing is that my wall calendar
had this watercolor picture (by DeepGreen)
for January that can be interpreted as a house on fire.
The January was really heated and busy for me.
But now it looks like the whole year
is going to be hot on events as well.

![watercolor image by DeepGreen from my calender](/blog/jan.jpg)

# Upd: March 13th

It seems that Arestovich have "predicted" the conflict a couple years ago at least.
With all kind of details. So all parties had plans and all parties were optimistic.

On one hand I like the ambition of the adventure. On another hand the cost is there.

Anyway the guy talks no-BS and likely is a valuable source of insight.
Also he is optimistic too.

# Upd: March 16th

Interesting issue was mentioned.
Arestovich mentioned some dehumanization of Russian people happening in Russia.

I have a view that there is class society here/there.
(I assume factually it is everywhere but here I assume it is more visible)

And if that's the case then it may cast a shadow on my previous claim about good demographics.
But it definetly casts a shadow on institutions.
No idea how much institutions match the demographics.

Another interesting issue that if he is right and they got the victory and get it reliably.
In Russia all these WW2 victory narratives and constant military movies would look so odd.
I can't imagine they continuing that like nothing happened.

The victory then is not only military but cultural and institutional.
I can't imagine what reforms are possible after such a victory.
And Ukraine may have some golden age starting there.

People like to see positive.
I hope the reality does not make people wait for it more than is needed.

# Upd: March 19th

Some people say the king is mad.
Some people were saying it from the start.
Meaning different things but anyway it is easy to succumb to positive thoughts here.

There are two videos that are related in a way.

- One is an old Ukrainian man showing destroyed military mashinery column part right around shattered village
- Another is Ukrainian civillians who have maneged to talk-off a column to take a route not through their living place

I watched the first one only and the man curses alot.
He praises Ukrainian military and curses Russian military.
While showing his house is destroyed by Ukrainians right with Russian mashinery.
You can hear that he is very confused by this.
So probably he was told in advance to leave his house so he got his life saved but now everything he knew is ruined.

So another village probably just stopped the column knowing that it will be striked and convinced the column.
Because they don't want their houses destroyed.

So I thought why would they hit houses as part of the column?
Probably for the same reason why they blow bridges - because these places become harder to pass: to slowdown.

So if my understanding is right.
Then normal civillians are basically used as hostages.

This is not normal civillians war and they don't need it.
And I'm happy to hear when they are able to save their places.

Overall I avoided flying before.
So flying to Belgrade was a mixed experience for me.

I have this anchored to the planes wing.

When I looked at the wing it was like more technical mind switches-on and starts modelling reality near me.
And that was not very comfortable mode.

Looking at the clouds and the Black Sea likely switched-on more relaxed and more aesthetical mind and the observed reality was having less of me.
More preferable, not really escapist/non-productive or confusing I think.

Yesterday I got to think about another such mode.
Like a confusion that still can be directed and having it's own "program" on some level.

Talking about confused there is also more shallow and kind of externally confused mode.

Anyway do I have any ideas on these observations?

I expect there to be value in the ability to discern these and to navigate them.
I assume any mix that does not have the "confused" part should be great.

One very abstract idea would be to bring technical stuff closer somehow and bring oneself into
to have the first mode. I imagine it like a Mario game that is actually gamified coding for example.

Concerning the second mode I think it is about having enough own or learned experience.
Maybe improving ability in asethetics or pattern recognition can be helpful.

And the confusing ones need external culture/system/tools or training by definition.

As I understand today the notion is applied to anything where elections are not obviously bought/stolen/taken by force.

And I have an impression that this word has really big halo not only among the demos but also part of some basic assumed ideology of talking/thinking classes.

Obviously it is too subvertable to be anything that can be called "good".
But the recent war shows that in competition against more "archaic" system it wins (as it looks now).

So the saying that it is the least bad of available options looks evidently right.

I haven't read anything on this.
So this is just toying around for the sake of seeing where it leads.

# General

I assume thinking requires certain context being fixed.
So by affecting this context they affect following thinking.

# Scales of Stories/Thinking

1. high-level: geographical: alliances, resources
1. middle level: normal human thinking in the more understandeable/predictable world
1. mechanical scale: short-term or magical thinking in unpredictable conditions

# Dehumanization*

My guess is that propaganda institutions pollute the middle level
and provide conditions for thinking in other levels.

# How Media Must be Operating on Levels

1. Statues on the TV performing rituals, high conceptions, limited access
1. Noise/nonsense, abuse of instincts of subjects
1. Fear/unpredictability spreading from the media

(I bet this is only one of ways to think about that)

(Also there may be different ways of dehumanization, for example
I believe it is dehumanization when subjects thinking attempts are interrupted
by nonsense and sofistry, but that is less relevant now even if pouplar too)

(And maybe there is actual warfare between different such systems)

---

# The Real World

Given these different levels it is impossibe to have a single "true story".

It is possible to have "good-enough evidence that supports/dismisses stories about facts".

So there are competing stories and competing facts.

But also there is the idea about class-warfare and ideology/language
serving that.

So there are competing stories, competing facts and cometing teams on top of that pile.

So politics/media are bound to be a mess if unconstained in their ways.

---

# On What This Reflects

There was a long trip with a taxist with who it
looked like I had an agreement at the time.
But somehow he without really doing anything special but with a couple of random phrases
convinced me that there is more stuff that is going-on.

Previously I gotten to like some more humane direction (that is not cheap or manipulative).
But then some exposure to some other stories moved me away from simple stories.
So things are a mess.
But only this understanding puts me in my place.

I definetly need to use some tools of thinking here.

---

# UPD: 9th of April (*)

Normally I have a suspicion to langage like that.
Anything de- or anti- is so much likely to be BS or used by confused people.

What I meant above was from a single-brain activity point of view.
But there are other things on different scales.

The question of what is human arises because of that.
And there are so many fake assumptions that the question is not obvious.

One popular naming somebody have came-up with is "orcs".
Both funny and having some point naming.
I imagine it becoming offensive and then all related books being banned.

Also there are conformists obviously.

And it was never a secret that different characters exist.
But now since the war-matter is not some arbitrary distinction
that is possible to ignore.
This distinction as it looks now touches human-nature.

Anyway de-humanization conflates meanings of having a human in the first place and then doing some dark magic to them.
And the meaning doing something that in historic terms produces
less humane populations.

The second meaning is what is meant most likely by more analytical talking heads.
The first meaning is how subjects should like to see it
because it flatters them and moves-away the responsibility.
Also the first one should appeal to those who prefer to see human nature
to be good and need to hear an explanation of what is observed.

And what I mentioned is just an angle to the space of logics and decision-making.

There are different meanings of demoralization that I'm aware of:
- Bezmenov meant total war by exporting ideologies that wipe-out moral reference-points and
  cause fracturing and internal conflict.
- Arestovich was talking about waves-like dynamics, I assume due to bio-chemistry
  that is more cyclical and maybe caused by strong stimuli in the first place
  (interestingly I got some of that observed by myself)

There should be more for sure but I like the interesting ones and I got this idea that
some signal demoralization (non-consuciously like most of things surely)
as some kind of warfare against mirror-neurones of others.

And there are many examples of this that I observed recently (Thase that look intentional are being produced by corporate entities).

Or at least can I get a better more premium-customer advice then?

For advice on how to save sanity it is already too late

Also these tips should be new every day.

Spoiler alert and all that.

I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago.
It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.

## Key points

- many things at once is how I see it
- the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating
- lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious
- it succeeded at confusing me at points surely
- effect: not scared but puzzled
  (which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis)
- high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes,
  different personalities,
  direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or
  you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there;
- fearless desensitized vs fearless normal
- magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably
- topic of desensitization by the industry
- enjoyed accents

## Quality

- all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though 
  there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling
  but the director did his work
  by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect;
- the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things
  and producing effects, "things perceptable and the general level
  is not distracting your from products",
  so there should be rewatch value from that for sure;
- it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad
  so you have your time to think about stuff,
  I liked that for sure,
  yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material;

# Exceprts

That "he is the director" I understood it (but not at that moment)
  as both:
  - some interesting humor about the way
    the director says "action!" in a way confusable with sneezing
  - that the director is not recognized (see part about the initial sequence)

One key scene: breaking window and cops hiding say: "- It is just a camera. - Is it?".
(I think aggressiveness of camera mentioned by Scorsese stems from
this scene and the question asked by the director directly)

## Ending Interpretation

In the end he found a new subject of interest for him,
but in order to acheive perfect focus and stillness
he uses his camera again to finish the picture.

Another life traded for the right effect produced,
collected at extremes, screaming for attention,
focused and amplified by cameras.

## Public

After watching it I got to check comments on a popular site and
they can't be reacted upon other than by the phrase "this is hopeless!".
Also given that the movie was initilly taken-down by public and
how that affected director's career.
I like to think that the director reserved the
honorable place of the initial sequence for them:
- the standards of public are not different from ones of that prosutitute: how much cash is in it?
- public is incapable to recollect what they have seen and unable to recognize the director like the grimacing lady on the stairs;
- the trash bin where director throws packaging form the used film
is where public opinions belong;

In this light it would be actually scary for public
to see themselves through mirrors in the directors camera.

I have a strange relation with this type of content.
I may get attracted to availability and perceived richness of content.
But then I'll get discouraged because it often may end-up being some story-telling.

Anyway social skills have a good marginal utility for me so I got to check what is there on the surface.

One book named "Surrounded by Idiots" was reviewed as being very useful for the HR and managerial crowd.

All similarities are accidental.
All characters are fictional and have no relation to the real world.

I was reading one book on in a way advanced `ruby`. And since I know that the ruby community can be quite good the standard
of expectations was quite high on my part.
I imagine in my mind that the book is by somebody who also is a library writer.

So it definetly starts with some good stuff from the logics point of view.
I enjoy learning such bits that make things clear.

But then I encountered that most of the text is a counter-revolution against that simplicity.

First I started to notice this pattern: the author creates an imaginary problem
like something must be "non-performant".
And then starts to turn ruby into some monstrous thing with different moves.
But then finally he finds flaws in the latest ugly solution so it is rejected too.

Those moves definetly bring alot of code examples and thus book volume.
And I'm aware that such moves have exploratory education value in theory.
But the pattern from "good" things to ugly things for arbitrary reasons is counter-intuitive and counter-ruby I'd say.
I have not checked for better ways to present such explorations I only state some annoyance
and reasoning behind it.

Then I started to skim through places and
what finished me is calling those who actively nag about the shape of ifs used during code review as "philosophers".
Why not to call them "philosopher-kings" right-away then?

Probably editor or some other "reviewer" must have nagged the author into doing all this.
Otherwise I would think that writing libraries should be considered harmful.

There is a mode of looking when things look interesting.
The mode actually takes you attention and there is wow-effect and it is not without minimal simplistic and mechanical "effort" to acheive and maintain.
The effort is only in paying attention.

So I was looking at the hand of it. To see what it does: is it being nervous or what.

For me this is the liberating way to look at it.
Because this way you are not distracted by some lustrous noise that is produced.

And you don't need an interpreter for what you see.
It is simple experience: not loaded, not distracted, but plain and simple.

It is almost being advertised given it's central place on the table.
With such advertisement Kunstkamera can't wait for another showpiece.
Genocide museums, modern art collectors and "capitalist" investors will fight to get it.

While third world dictators fear it like a plague because it brings bad luck.
Still they will try to get it too so it can be sent to some other enemy dictator in a box.
Or be put under the door.

The exhibition will travel the world this way.

## Incidents

I got this mixed intuition about recent vandals activation.
They happen to act right inside walls of Western public cultural institutions.
So I wanted to untangle it.

## Analysis

My intuition (somewhat outsider) sees them as examples of hard deflection from the original Western values.
And this deflection happens at the time of bigger challenges and higher-priority issues.
And this context makes it look both pathetic in comparison and out of touch too.

I should say that I have different cultural context to say the least.
So there is a chance that among the target audience in the West it does not looks as brutally pathetic as it is.

So what I see is the combination of:

1) deflection at the time of challenges
1) distraction from higher-priority matter
1) out of touchiness, lack of ideas
1) thus pathetic look also
1) unethical in deeds but covering with words and talking about ethics surely

It reminds me something.
And is really asking for checking things out for external influence.

Alternatively I can imagine this to be a sign of exhaustion of ecological activism movement.
Because of how badly they delivered Germany into dependence from Russia 
and now hysterical denial is the only thing that is left for them?

Also I believe there is a word in the German like "verscheißen" or so
and it means to fail spectacularly and it was quite popular thing to do in some sense.
So maybe that fashion returns?

## Solution

It is easy to solve.

You are not allowed to bring dogs inside many buildings because they can do some sort of "verscheißen".
So uncultured humans should also be disallowed to enter or only allowed 
under full responsibility of an able person.

While average IQ declines you either separate the bad apples or decrease quality for good people too.
Current trend is still on devaluation.
I wonder how long it can continue.

## Perspective

As in Ukraine. Recognizing that when justice is restored and debts are paid.
Then ruined buildings and landscapes of current can be seen as monuments of sovereignty and self-determination.
Evidence of cost paid.

Vandalized pictures are the evidence of barbarians inside the gates too.
Europe has an opportunity to wake-up from the current sleep too.
And by paying the cost to build a monument of the new dawn and new epoch.

From a perspective of a random non-educated

too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.

I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance
that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it's power.

I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions
even if they are loading them.
And thus in form they continue to exist like circles on the water even when the original meaning is lost from the public discourse.

# Summary

Good soviet movie about middle-aged males gathering for a trip.
The viewer has lots of moments of reflection on deep matters of existence and life.
Offering nostalgia and sharpened sense of time.

# Context

The movie was mentioned on Arestovich's program twice AFAIK.
So that added it to my list.

Normally after having listened to some classics it is especially hard to
get me interesting in a soviet movie with military theme.
But this one was chosen and it got my attention from the start.

# Short Notes (spoilers and all)

Initial sequence with organ playing and astronomy laboratory definitely gets one into the right mood.
Then unexpectedly dramatic accent near mail boxes tells that this is something totally different.
Music in the movie definitely tells one when things are not what they seem.

Great night scene idea with fires an a bank and plane reflection in the river
is the first time it visually resolves the question of parade of planets.
Then reflections of sun in windows and the group moving together in one direction is the parade itself.

Generally it is not being fully direct and one has to discover some meanings and some smaller can be left undecided.
Yet clues are accentuated so it looks as if by intent the main question is meant to be resolved on the first watch.
The movie also follows different representatives of soviet society.
I think addittional clues and accents show that it was meant to be understood, remembered and being useful for less sophisticated classes too.
I like it when creativity goes hand in hand with humanity while being true to reality.

## Context

I ended-up watching some movies recently.
One of them ended-up being Memento.
Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.

## Idea

The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place.
This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.

## Movie

The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order.
Each has its own references mostly in regard to questions of memory and communication.
I found topic of drugs abuse and isolation being represented too but more indirectly.

There is a different way of looking when one checks a movie or probably even a text backwards.
This may allow one to see more references and get more from each scene by itself.
In this way movie offers double value from the first watch because one can see scenes 
in isolation from the first watch while always seeking to understand what is going on.

I like how tattoos got their own living on a body.
But then there are index-cards and beer-mats for communication with others and oneself.
I wonder how this is not a comedy and probably I was watching it too seriously.
There is way more humor than what I was able to appreciate because I was watching it too seriously.
I was watching it a second time probably and was more like a detective to have something to write after.
Humor in the movie is absurd yet consistent with a serious plot.
If Nolan did not emphasize the depth of the topic the movie could compete with some Guy Ritchie stuff
but maybe the first-watch impression is more like that which is cool.

In a way one respects the determination.
Then as a bonus there is also this odd innocence when he does not know what he have done recently.
But then there is a bunch of rewritten memories so one can see
why this obliviousness and determination would make sense from more psychological point of view.
So under the surface is quite bad mess.

Everybody uses the protagonist here and there.
But he uses them too because they assist in constructing/execution of "his" scenario and they are part of the external system.

The protagonist does not like to remember he likes to forget.
By closing the eyes in the past he solves unwinding of the impossible maze in the current.

Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial.
May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.

The director is a master of visual language.
This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.

I'll just mention one scene.

The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows.
After that you see details that are necessary but I'll skip them to not elaborate further.

Could exclamation mark mean The Hanged Man tarot card?
Let's check Wikipedia and it quotes the 1910 book by A. E. Waitie: 

> (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. [...] I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.

Mariken in the beginning of the movie contemplates questions of life and not death while she lay among dead.

There may be a feeling that this interaction is far fetched.
But there are pieces of the picture outside the scene.
And this exclamation gives the mind the anchor to reunite the image there.

My favorite genre is the one where exclamation marks pose questions
and where doorways frame invisible compositions.
There is a pleasure of mind in discovery.

The depth is created by progression because even more limited look offers insights.
When one reads closer to the text at hand then the exclamation highlights the following scene as one needing additional
attention and thus another look.
Because it has a puzzle, a pattern and an abstraction.
In visual text exclamation marks are put before sentences but ultimately in the middle.

This is just one example demonstrating boldness and quality of the director's work.

# Path

Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change.
It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece.
It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.

Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev.
Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology.
Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings.
Given me being outsider to these crafts I got impressed by the experience technology used there.
Both in verses and the video on top of them.
This time the experience was without the "noise in torn-out ears without head" in the process
and this more professional-like clear-minded look produces no less impression.
Although I still visibly have a prejudice against this approach maybe because it is finite, maybe because it implies some level of organization.

Then given enough of diversified input irregardless of flashiness or smartness of images this
kind of apex looses it's magics and is understood more as a corner.
Brighter genres are seen with new eyes.
And the reversal of a kind is there.

The turn was crowned by the Chaplin's A Days Pleasure.
It is fun, more than smart and has just enough depth.
The depth is created by different axes and different freedom.

# Abstract

I must say that it is a perfect sequence.
The negative apex when seen already from the right context is recalled as interestingly directed right
by incorporating disgust response.
I highlighted only more monumental points in the post and all evaluations are context-dependent.

# Koans

My understanding of mechanics behind zen koans is that one gets answers to any questions they have thought about.
The answer one gets is given in understandable language and in relevance to the situations one deals with.

One Russian translator of ancient texts on a Russian Buddhism forum translated the topic statement with the meaning
that the great city has no outskirts.
And it makes sense in it's way.

# Personal experience

At one point I posed the topical question to myself, invested some unusual but not too much time
and got a delayed answer.
I remember the answer to be strong and with effects.
I cannot remember the answer itself.
Probably it was paired to some priorities shift so the wording does not really matter.

As a side note there are those who seek effects by themselves in such circles.
And I graduated from that early.
But some echo finds itself in other forms that are just more productive as I see it.
The difference in productivity is the same as the difference in writing posts versus writing on your hands.

# Soviet Zen

Potential disclaimer: Some images here I got unexpectedly fast so it may be that I accidentally stole them from Pelevin that I read back in a day.
Whether this is the case or not I see possible influence
and the absurdity of times inspired multiple pictures and texts.

Another context would be somebody who consumes propaganda daily.
Soviet++ times.
At the time TV sets were black and white.
With heavy glass screens that are filled with gas inside.
So the shape of the screen itself was rounded while the box of the TV was rectangular.
Also there were circular lenses to increase size of the screen right before it on the earliest exemplars.
And propaganda itself does round every corner like it does not exist
while trying to steal attention by every corner of a circle out there.

Every soviet citizen is trained in zen regularly by
sitting still and looking at the great square
that is refracted through the circle of invisible workers.
Mandatory enlightenment guarantees that soon one
starts to see every shape of the universe as both circles and squares simultaneously.
And the only time this mystical duality is allowed to collapse to a specific shape is
when when the party line happens to cross it.

Even after the Soviet Union collapsed itself many adepts among people still covertly practice
all the rituals of thinking and maintain the altar in their head.

# Analysis

I should say that unfortunately they may be right is some sense.
They were right in predicting things to go back.

My highlight would be of a persistent problem of culture because of failure of transfer
and failure of the system and local civic institutions.
I think even good parts of soviets were not transferred well (if it was possible at all).
So cultural capital was destroyed or was failed to be created.

Culture capital need to be reestablished on a more dependable ground already.

On the outside it is a music box that is visually tasty and theatrical.
When you open it you are there for multitude of melodies of crying among other serious and humorous lines.

This may make an impression of some femininity aspect
or certain serious non-seriousness, naivete and oversimplification/cliche-even
or even offensive to somebody's perception of normal and mirror-neurons abuse.

Offended crowd is not the one worth listening to
but still perception of such toys may need the right mindset that they don't possess.

It can be perceived that often some personal boundaries or concern for status is missing.
This allows the director/author to show some unusual drama openly/closely.

Concerning serious lines the biggest character conflict is between
Javert and Valjean.
Both are driven by their drama and both possess character more than would be rational to have.
So they are principled.
Javert represents the static/order side and his tower collapses in the end.
Valjean represents dynamic/adaptable side and he starts new life every now and then and even after his death.

Concerning humor the funny crooks couple is the entertaining bit in that too-serious and dramatic world.

There are lots of low-life behaviors in general. Different martyrdom too.
And I'm not a fan of any martyrdom given how it plays out for worthy and principled individuals
in Belarus and Russia.
On the one hand the plot does not give too much of false promise when the revolution is crushed.
On the other hand it still may look like it offers something unclear in the end.
But I assume it is to close the music box on a positive note for it's function is complete then.
And probably this puts the positive song into the memory to hold as a summary.

Another lacking thing it seems intelligence too.
Probably Javert and the state represented it.
Probably times were so unreasonable and the state was failing too.
The movie probably highlights value of faith in it's core sense in such times.

One definition of horizon is a boundary line at which the earth and sky appear to meet.
Other connotations are: boundary, limit, stage/level.

Add the notion of planning/time horizon and the difference it makes to how mind processes things.

During the previous year I got to read some of Igor Guberman short but sharp writings.
They are often smart and touch on different topics while they can easily contain raw language.

In this year I got to check short-form writings by Piet Hein.
I thought that there is likely to be an inheritance/influence between the authors.

First is obviously similar short form.

Second is political angle.
As I understand Piet Hein wrote generally interesting pieces but with contextual second meanings relevant to German occupation of Denmark of that time.
Igor Guberman writing is more open and costed him imprisonment in Soviet Union.

Then the ultimate inheritance that surprised me the most was visual.
It looks like a drawing by Piet Hein was interpreted by Igor Guberman and then applied to create a new piece that is still relevant to Russia.

# by Piet Hein

(translation by G. L. Vardenga)

Лишь шутку в шутке замечать<br />
И лишь серьезное в серьезном –<br />
Воистину не различать<br />
Ни одного в единстве розном.<br />

![image drawn by Piet Hein with two different masks that are half-merged and a person who has fallen under them](/blog/grook.png)

# by Igor Guberman

Напрасно телевизоров сияние,<br />
театры, бардаки, консерватории:<br />
бормочут и елозят россияне,<br />
попав под колесо своей истории.<br />

# more

Having one obvious but not stated piece of interpretation in place makes it fit very well.
And there are other text pieces by Igor Guberman that fit exactly this picture!
Seeing this underlying "structure" is what opens the door to see the creative process
of the author and it shows additional nuances.

In the morning I looked at the the Moon movement against the horizon, spire and the clear sky.
I assume stars could be similarly useful background too.

Movement perception and image perception are somewhat different systems as scientific evidence established and that idea is already entertaining by itself.
But the subjective experience has it's own weight.

And if you are me then surely you would have five interesting hypotheses about how your
movement vector could have been biased and start writing about it
until evidence shows to reasonable degree that it wasn't.

But to the core experience.

The point of looking at the the Moon is to see how the movement is communicated
by different means while the object you perceive as moving at the same time looks as stable.
Since the evidence is conflicting the perception is felt by different pathways/means.

It is scary to think about ways in which the Moon could communicate the movement
to people with pathological imagination.

On the other hand the Moon is not lying.
Because there is that basic illusion and a blind spot in everybody's eye
and the Moon silently reminds you now and then about it.

# Then

I try to install a habit for reading from time to time.
Previous attempt was Faust that weights 2 kilos because of big format and stylistically different but exceptional pictures on every other page.
Such pictures were competing with images in the text but I enjoyed both.
One notable experience such book can give is when you are trying to analyze through some text
and turn the page and see some unexpected picture.
Then this picture can sink your active attention as some exit that you grasp and appreciate like you would not expect.

# Now

I have read How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren.
It is a practical book that keeps you interested.
On one hand it offers a technique of analysis of texts.
On the other hand it also has entertaining bits here and there.

I got some interest in grammar lately.
And I think this interest is one of contributors to reading interest too.
Well written books have a virtue in demonstrating grammatical plays among other things.

Respectable reading list at the end is one of the great features.

# Paths Forward

Also there are pre-made collections that overlap with the reading list.
Gateway to the Great Books has easier and shorter texts/excerpts and it is around 5000 pages.
Great Books of the Western World has a ten years reading plan with it but it has more authors than one would expect.
Also there is Syntopicon for the most demanding but topical paths through books.

In the GBWW I noticed that the choice of translation of Iliad might be not the most exciting;
I'm not at the position to judge at this point but likely it was a compromise choice and possibly with accessibility in mind (what implies broad audience and lower barrier for the first read experience).

Ten years plan starts with Plato's Apology.
Given that I have heard it a couple of times,
looking at the first sentence I see the gravity of it.

The Gateway looks too light for my taste, will see how I can handle Plato.

# Considerations

Of course these days one can not rely on classical books only and one has to mix in the latest scientific findings on topics that have a potential to undo all philosophical books as some say.
But I assume it is not granted that one can see through biases and ideologies so having overview of what was there makes sense.

Also AI can make access to information as available to make reading for information less practical.
Anyway there is ability exercise, certain refined satisfaction and grammatical forms that I'm after.

# Overview

Best known piece where Plato poses big question vividly.
The question touches many topics and can be seen from different angles.
Humor lightens the reading while also bringing Socrates closer
thus increasing the gravity of the question.

Angles obvious to me:
- character vs shadows
- duty vs whatever
- high cost of truth vs mass of conformists
- individual ethics vs median masses mechanics/(im)morality
- political/ideological: "undemocratic logic" of considering what is best as opposed to wherever masses go
- political/class: rich young followers
- intergenerational and other decay/corruption of Athens
- inadequate court process, circus by definition

Unforgettable quote: "by the dog I swear!"

# Context

After two Plato dialogues the "10 years" reading list has Clouds by Aristophanes.
Socrates summons a chorus of clouds in the play.
I stopped at that point for whatever reason.

I see how Aristophanes is not wrong in his own way.
Simple good sounding ideas that are virtuous otherwise can have their own limited use.
It seems they are not enough/reliable to bring better standards into political/collective setting. Even though great minds came very close to finally solving the question posed.

Anyway initially I thought about going through classics by some stable plan.
But the plan got destabilized because my views on philosophy got updated.
So I'm not into going through all the tree of attempts to resolve the hard question.
I'll just shortcut it instead of clouding myself.

This leaves me divided between Montaigne, languages, abstract fundamental stuff and hopefully arts.

After getting excited by New York Stories.
I thought a bit about whether co-creation in form of potentially loading posts about movies with my at times far reaching interpretations or implications is the right thing to do.

I say it can't be other way.
Authentic and entertaining go together in my mind.
So the genre of this personal blog should be something around: random observations and imaginations well-mixed in a skull shaped bowl and sprinkled with grammar errors.

Doing co-creative interpretation more deliberately could be fun too but in that case it is more demanding.
So I'm divided on the deliberation idea and it looks like a piece should be concieved with such use implied
in order to provide both freedom and pleasure to work with.
I'm not sure if David Lynch movies fit there.
I think any rich piece or even multiple can be mixed for something different.
Or actually good detective or even history investigation could leave the choice to the reader.
And then the reader/viewer can fill-in with own hand what is missing.

I think completeness and coherence is the quality that frees the viewer from that part of work.
And in some sense not giving that to the viewer is alike to cheating and imposing.
To compensate for that directors offer some plausible interpretation along hints for other ways.
Or otherwise there is stylistical hint to not expect coherence.

On a crossroads if lights show me green before I get there - I skip this turn regardless of how much time is there.
It doesn't sound like a "herd behavior" on one hand.
But unusually this leads to me crossing the road with a crowd on every crossroads this way.

Anyway if it shows me green, instead I go check the newspapers I never check or I find something interesting.
When it gets to red I may get around but I'm not going to look at another side or to stay in the crowd.

So that day I noticed that pavement on a crossroads has certain quality.
It is almost nothing special but it gives you impression of respectability every time you make a step.
I thought that it should sound certain way that I assume but can't clearly recognize.

After crossing the road there are different statues.
One is like a tree segment. Another makes a step with big boots.

And architecture.
If architecture is still music that ascends from the pavement then how should it sound if one walks against these walls?

Another crossroads shows red and there is a minute plus.
Looking somewhere perpendicular.
Then you notice that this time it is not you who look around but it is the city that looks at you.
It looks from towers and there are windows between other buildings.
It is asking as if to entertain itself but not because it needs an answer.
A minute before green when you are perfectly content and appreciate
the connection that fills the space.

On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions.
While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.

It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance.
Operational democracy is a demanding beast.

# Note

I don't pursue the topic systematically while complexities of it get my attention periodically.
So I highlight some aspects that look new to me but since I don't have a bigger picture yet
there is a higher risk of misinterpretation and inherent incompleteness of statements.

Awoke and looked at the starts in the night.
Eyes may be more relaxed and sensitive at that time.
Also I assume they may move slower and movements may be less calibrated.

Some stars are clear, some are twinkling, and other are faint.
While clear stars make a space with landmarks.
Through twinkling one comes to faint and they are the interesting ones.
They are both fish and water of the night sky.

The way eye interacts with these objects is inherently dynamic.
These hazy stars almost draw your eye movements on the sky.
Sometimes you spot some flickering evidence of presence in some waters.
Sometimes landmarks appear to be moving like it is floating.
Sometimes eye draws a spark between the two.

Watched the piece again and saw some of it's riches.

The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called "unveiling".
Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa right there.
But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.

Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.

Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don't know why yet.
Is it another echo? But this one is subtle enough to puzzle you whether it is there.

I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg.
I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.

First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it.
Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can't unsee it.
This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be.
Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them.
Then surely given unusual state of affairs of roles Al Pacino offers another entertaining piece of the picture.
Also I think innate visual fabric of the movie may suggest some further ideas but it is as if some frame or composition is not there to be sure.

Anyway comparatively the movie is more lucid, bright (is it more comics-like?)
And as the character of the protagonist is inverted
so I may guess that Nolan took some pattern and installed it in an inverted way too.

The Skjoldbjærg's movie initially looks simpler and more ordinary.
Then you get some statements that are memorable.

So I think both movies are good for me and Nolan's version could be more entertaining in general.
Yet still I assume the general public is likely to miss his play.

Nolan always tries to experiment with time.
In Memento he describes existence that lasts for only a couple of minutes.
Next in this movie it is a long day that never ends for the protagonist.
Then you get splits in Prestige, layered reality in Inception and reverse motion in Tenet.
I bet other movies have their fair share of such ideas in some form too.

Previously I had this assumption that the most valuable language to learn must be most different from the native tongue.
Now while learning some Serbian I got to see that learning similar language has it own advantages.
Because of similarities it is easier to see parallels and to reflect back on parts of the native language that you were not aware of.
And even though actual etymology may be not as straight-forward as it seems, the current picture of a language matters.

One pretty feature of Slavic languages I got to think about is similarity of words for speech and river.
If one thinks about it — it makes sense.

- Rich movie, unforgettable images
- Lots of echoes inside
- Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain

Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time.
Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.

Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie.
The more patched nature of the movie may relax constrains on interpretation of scenes to some extent.
The movie even has abstract poetry read at some point, what highlights and invites ambiguity.
Level of details and different themes touched makes for a rich mix and questions posed of different level of visibility anchor viewer to pay attention.
Echoes in the movie helps you compose the picture in non-linear way for even richer composition to go beyond superficial limits of the medium.

Visual language has this inherent feature of allowing additional interpretations.
Yet the artist weaves a picture where even different interpretations are in their place.
And even though there is ambiguity on the surface, certain clarity shines through it.

I didn't plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially.
But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing
so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day.
In fact I'll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their
selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.

So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty
I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to.
And I told him that I'm entertaining this idea.
But the real idea was, whether I should have them done without anesthesia.
On one hand it is not what I'm used to do at all. On the other hand missing
such an opportunity would be so wasteful.

So I have read tips from my previous dentist post in the series.
And then I went that day while still not being certain enough.
The destination place lies in a quieter part of the city so I had one hour trip by foot to reach it.
And this is enough time to come-up with the decision.

The decision point was when I decided to not make a big feat of it.
Just by assuming the pain is going to be moderate/limited and by this fact itself some psychological load should be out and effectively that will make it moderate.
Asserted a little victory there.

In the chair with somebody's fingers in my mouth sometimes I was thinking uncomfortably about meaning of those finger biting scenes in La Dolce Vita, also about that "fingers of gloves" abstract poetry.

Should I want to fit all the entertaining stuff about this trip that would demand more writing abilities from me.
Probably taste and composition would require introduction of fiction into it.
This one is true to reality so I'll leave it there.

# Context

I've got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately.
Then I've read some Gombrich and there he features the painting.
The painting straightened me up a bit.

Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer
but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself.
This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.

# Picture

I enjoyed the piece for sure.
If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findings then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well.
But I want to comment on the leftmost figure because the figure could not be understood without understanding the core of the scene.

Every figure is multi-faceted and and the left figure could even play different otherwise incompatible roles.

Possibly it plays both initial bliss of ignorance as well as certain post factum experience.
Also my guess is that the figure plays the painter who contemplates the scene.
This way of looking at it opens the very right part for additional interpretations.

I've been listening to the book little by little.
And I there are some interesting ideas in the book.
One idea as I recall it is that if a war goes for one year,
assume it will go for another year;
if it goes for two years then assume additional two.

So first I got to think about unpredictability of finishing wars.
Then the next day some reality-show coup grabbed everybody's attention.
Yet at the evening of the same day things "normalized" as if nothing happened.
So as an illustration to the book I got to experience some mutant two-headed black-swan.

Also there is some odd entertainment value in knowing that the author has
irrational issue with normal distribution
so he injects complaining remarks about it all over the place.
But overall this type of entertainment is not what I'm used to.

And along with the blind-spot author has he loaded the book with different shiny things.
For example the author surely tied to spice the book with french words all over,
but it did not add style.

Also I was listening at 1.5x speed and that only escalated perceived non-seriousness.

On one hand it is not perfect to not finish books.
On the other hand one should trust own judgment.
So I cut it short.

Another trip to a dentist. Nearby dentist this time.
Initially for this appointment I had to write own name at the website.
The problem is I feel like I have three of them now.

- one is official name transliteration into English; that begs the question of how to pronounce that
- next is the English version of the name; but I'm not from England or the US
- Serbian version of the similar name; which should sound most naturally

So for the appointment I used the Serbian to have less confusion.
But then already there I used English for communication so I got to think about the naming again.

The dentist at the end wanted to write me into some visits log book.
But when I told him that I have three names he just gave it to me so I can write something by myself.
I still had to choose one but this time I also got this exceptional hotel guestbook experience.

I wanted to visit this one for the second time (with rewinds both forward and back).

There are small scenes that would look arbitrary or meaningless but they are not.
It is very satisfying to see the director's play and then he confirms it too.

That picture that he nods to in the final sequence got me interested.
It is a funny scene on the first look.

Another look is to compare the picture to one of the latest girl talking scenes.
That brings starting monologue of the director.
Then ultimately compare it to the final shot through the window.

Final movie by the director.
Things expressed are bound to be misunderstood by many.
Unexpressed things are bound to disappear.

- Visual, some shapes just do not take verbal forms
- Director-ness, Peeping Tom degree of it
- Your Blue Room - chroma key room

---

P.S.

The nod can also bring bring Claudia Cardinale from Conversation Piece.
Or Asian theme from La Dolce Vita.
But this must cross a line into some inside language.

---

P.S.S.

As I understand it Wim Wenders shot framing of the picture and intermissions between the four stories.
This framing talks own story and there was some disagreement between directors.
Given the capital of this picture I'm going to have another try of some other work by Wenders.

Wenders was "loud" and explicit in own way in the picture.
But scenes like that helicopters scene they have progression/potential in them
and that creates sense of depth and quality of detalization.
On my previous incomplete attempt I got some shallow impression of the director and maybe there was just alien style with similar loudness in that movie.
But I think the degree of explicitness is necessary to invite into more ambiguous play.

So one point is that alien loud style does not necessitate shallowness.
Another point probably is that different people would see patterns/depth in different domains and so directors produce in domains where they have ideas and thus different pictures may cover different areas and have different match.

Also this big filter of aesthetical preferences is a mechanism of it's own.
So I still haven't decided whether to suspend aesthetical judgment and reconsider the alien movie or to select another one.

# Langscape

I didn't read much so my verbal faculty is likely more affected by programming than by stories.
More affected by reflection than by communication.

The way I use language in these posts is in a way minimalistic and analytical.
I assume the text file supports the brain working memory.
That maybe frees some pattern recognition resources.
And recognizing patterns should build the ability to recognize them in general.

So my verbal space is always incomplete at least culturally.
And since I started writing these posts it is always in the backlog for potential work-in-progress.

Some background:
- I got some interesting experience of speech as warfare about two years ago
- also got a 1.5 years of consuming "good propaganda"
- got to learn some new language vocabulary
- got some courses with tips in the verbal space

So I recently:
- checked around fundamental differences in letters and corresponding sounds
- the second time approached A Syntopicon on a very high-level
- finally got desensitized and analytical about "good propaganda"
- I even checked one book on improv that had quotes from Anne Frank Diary

But also.

I believe there is inertia in peoples verbal spaces.
That is probably related with people learning new languages with religions or with other new values and world-view maybe.
It is interesting how learning new tongue has a promise of getting new eyes.

Anyway if I put my verbal langscape into visual language then it has:
- province at poisoned berries bushes that invoke trashy and headless humor
- some rabbit holes that I'm not crossing yet
- labyrinth of abandoned constructions with graffities on all walls invoking "victory"

Now.

Attempting to parse some consistent volume of audio with vocals in another language to see what is there.

Even though the pace of the movie may be not too fast and given certain melancholy and lots of internal monologues there.
After watching the movie it actually left positive if not optimistic and very humane impression.

On the 10-th minute there is explicit visual play with reflected lights.
And this sets the standard and expectation.
So the viewer is practically encouraged to analyze other visuals used.
But also that play by itself may worth a rewatch or two after the fact.

Stimulating and rich picture as by me.
Story is one thing but I focus on associations and potential connections that are brought by non-verbal tools used.

Also who would expect that Berlin wall with all the weird faces on it to make sense now.

# Story Spoilers

- Orthogonal worlds, question of meaning and mechanicality
- The artist performing on the edge summons the angel into the world
- The angel proclaims the vision using her like a flag

# Sequel

The first movie left a question potentially to be resolved later.

I checked only 40 minutes of the sequel and it looks flat, also it lacks any meaningful relation to the first movie.

I liked the plane through the ear scene.
This may reference the "a camel going through the eye of a needle" but in German it is called ear of a needle.
Even if the specific reference is not confirmed the scene still can be entertaining.

But otherwise this looks like obvious genre and target audience switch.
And the character of Cassiel has traded that darker mystery to fit the role.
Which means watching this would devalue the first movie experience that still has ripples here and there.
Also the more consumer-friendly genre is bound to reduce informational density of the movie so this moves it further down the list.

But probably sequeling the movie did not make sense in the first place.
I assume the first movie is already a balanced picture that leaves the right amount to be completed by the viewer.

# Tangent

I watched once some course by a painter in California I believe.
The course was just introducing the color-wheel and then painting it using oil paints.
The instructor was bigger jewish guy that was more concerned and detailed on obvious instructions than I expected.
Anyway after paying some good interactive attention to the gradations on the wheel I got the experience
that may be compared to seeing colors/gradations for the first time.
Then you see that color perception is context dependent which makes things more complex than what color-wheel seems to promise.

Also seeing shapes for the fist time is a question of paying attention to them.
Probably "for the first time" qualifier is about perception having higher broadband then memory/imagination at the moment.

Anyway I bet the director by colors in the most notable faces on the wall scene means not color perception per se.

I have experienced the sudden escalation effect of the picture.
I wonder if background information and other pictures influenced that experience too or the picture is self-contained.

I assume this picture for me has opened the door for other works of the author. I wonder if it casts a shadow too.

# Context

Even though I've seen some of this director and I recall some things to be interesting
I otherwise avoided watching his work because the name seemed too popular.
Checked this one for a random reason.
I wasn't sure about the choice for the first half maybe.
But then the director delivered technically.
And then I got to see the conception that is brilliant too.

# Summary

Delivered in colorful and crinkling packaging to distract the viewer;
simultaneously Christmas and Halloween joke played right on the viewer;
yet also having a personal down to earth snapshot of not obvious family business management at one point.

# Content (spoilers)

Technically the joke is quite strong.
The scariest thing to me was a cat and the key to resolve the puzzle was a can of beer.
So double faced technical play of mirrors is one way to interpret the movie poster.

The movie at times associated to some of Lynch but the director here did not go to make a kaleidoscope
and the movie even though puzzling still is resolvable.

I assume for bigger effect one is expected to had seen some of confusing movies with symbols around
and that kind of activity of the watcher helps to build the culmination.

One early notable sign that ask you to pay attention and ask questions is a smile and
bye-bye gesture of Bill to his daughter while accidentally he is lit from below.

Another interesting aspect of the movie is that the actual main actor of the movie
is Alice and not Bill even though his unusual adventures are the main content by volume.

I see this as a story of dealing with lies in family relationships (which is raw and down to earth topic)
yet the story contains masterful manipulation and dreams (which seemed to be another matter completely).
Her story about her dream could easily be a lie constructed.
His adventures could be her imaginations about what he does.

It is a type of lucid Disney movie crossing into a horror film. The earliest erotic movie. Melodrama about nuns.

> Spoilers may lie ahead.

# Team

In director's commentary M. Powell mentions:

- high quality of the team and art department
- cases of intrinsic match of actors to roles
- directors role of believing in the project
- how the team kind of lived through the movie (without big picture possibly?)

And this final point probably assumes a degree of improvisation on actors part in the process
and also a degree of freedom during the editing part.
Although I have information about the director being very exacting.
So I have no idea really.

# Dialogues

First dialogue between Mr. Dean and sister Clodagh is not plain and that is how they all are going to be.
There is always undercurrent of either humor or sensuality.

Because dialogues are "interesting", acting therefore has higher resolution to pay attention to.
I enjoyed acting even though I'm not a judge in matters.

Characters choice looks clear and balanced too given that I only started to pay attention to that aspect with this film.


# Cuts

M. Scorsese as a major director himself pays a lot of attention to cuts in the commentary.
He points attention and provides references.

It makes sense because cuts are what directors solve distinctly from static visual artists.
It is this type of black matter of the movie - you are not supposed to really see it but
it has it's effect and I believe there is a lot more that happens on cuts level than general audience attributes to it retrospectively.


# Visuals (strong visual spoiler)

Surely there are enjoyable shots, scenes, decisions.

Nuns are like snowy mountains while Mr. Dean is wearing a kind of black halo over a head.


# Screen

In commentary M. Scorsese recommends to watch it specifically on the big screen projected as all of this collaboration movies.
Interestingly BFI will have multiple runs of Black Narcissus in October and November in London.
I don't think 9 meter BFI NFT1 qualifies for big but still the event seems rare.


# Bad Humour

I bet a lot of scripts are variations of the three-body problem in physics.
You just don't know which body hits into what first.

I've noticed new and unexpected juice-making machine in the shop I visit periodically.
But also my path to shop goes near a juice-drinking joint that got closed a couple of months ago.

Now since the joint got closed there are dead bugs that seem to accumulate inside.
And it has a very good overview with a wall of glass.
So it is in a way like this big insect aquarium.
It would be entertaining but I don't believe that there is no limit to their accumulation.

Anyway I haven't yet written on A Matter of Life and Death but I was thinking about it and it's potential relation with The Tempest.
Anyway I haven't read The Tempest to confirm.

Today while moving by I checked myself against the bent glass of the aquarium rounded corner and saw the ceiling of the place.
It is roughly teal of color and has wires going out grouped from many different points like little lightnings.
It's almost like they got their own frozen artificial tempest there too.

I was looking for a project this summer so I had some random interactions over the internet.
Two of interactions had some strange quality.

One is what I recall as short and bald guy from post-Soviet territory.
He had a very attentive look as if at every moment he was looking at spinning slots.
He had a gambling project and he even said that involvement
in such projects is less ethically challenging than
being involved in prostitution business.
But then to support the claim he pulled some retro casino game box with "girl on the front cover".
He thought that the disclaimer that the casino has no age limit should support his claim.

Another encounter has got to be recurring.
A recruiter has got into a habit to call me every couple of months
for no apparent reason.
He even called me as if it was accidental call and he had the wrong number.
Even if he changed the voice I still would recognize him by the British accent.
And I watched some darker British comedies back in a day and it makes these talks to sound additionally strange and entertaining.

Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.

Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.

Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and "flight from Berlin".
Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.

There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored.

Extremely visual and educating on those matters but as it happens it is not too comfortable experience.
And I should say that even Peeping Tom was more "polite" when it comes to "uneasiness" than this movie.
So it was almost necessary to analyze how director controls the tension and conjures images at needed moments.

The whole movie is such a complex dissonance that the simple ending
looks strange after the movie.
And that leaves perception of incompleteness even.
Surely I see how people should be put back onto the earth after seeing this at the cinema so it makes sense.

It is almost like this kind of movies need a more foolish and sunny followup to fully close it.
For example Wings of Desire has one as it seems. But that one was way lighter.
Also there is a plenty of entertaining parallels between these movies if one is after things not said.
But I'm not going those rabbit holes.

P.S.

Talking about wrapping things up from more visual perspective I found the book returning sequence being marvelous.
It is exceptional but I have missed it because of certain scepticism.
The existing book cover is used with one modification I assume.
So I've changed my mind about incompleteness.

P.P.S.

Among other things what was notably for me with this piece is how images or dynamical scenes are retained in memory and are changed over time.
How good wrapping of such content is a trick on it's own.

Also one can find interesting echoes to Cardsharps among ather references in the movie.
In a way the director not only referenced but highlighted specific features of the painting.
Where part of them I perceived and retained I did not pay attention to painters tools initially.
But after the movie I rechecked the painting and understood more of the technical magics involved.
