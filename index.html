    <h2>Unmasking the Face</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context There is a breaking of the forth wall element in theater/cinema. I recall the name only after I start to see significance of such tools. For example in Killer’s of the Flower Moon there are at least two sneaky breakings of the fourth walls and one obvious in the end. I’d say even if sneaky they signify key moments to consider.
For whatever questionable reason I watched Perfect Days by Wim Wenders too recently....</p>

    <h2>Killers of the Flower Moon</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Before What got my attention to the movie is unexpected change on one channel. The channel had comments turned off and occasionally different art was posted there. Then there appeared somewhat simplistic yet dissonant review of the movie and comments went turned on. I knew that M. Scorsese looks into ethnical differences and criminal characters and groups. I think I guessed right at the time what moved the channel’s author....</p>

    <h2>Audible</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve been checking Audible lately. It does not make good impression on the outset. So I decided to search for Quigley there. Instead search got me some parody to his book that has the same name with “101” added at the end.
There are present actual quotes of Quigley so the book can not be called absolute waste of time. While of course everything else in it is. Notably:
quotes from Wikipedia quotes from fiction own opinions of that 101 author The way that “author” repeats themselves shows how low of an opinion they are about the audience of that “book”....</p>

    <h2>Quigley</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve read The Evolution of Civilizations by C. Quigley.
scientific approach insightful content yet very available: clear language and simple sentences Author explains scientific method, dynamics of development of civilizations in terms of instruments and institutions, morphology between levels of abstraction, also he only mentions at the end law vs fact model of understanding. The way author ends the book compels one to check more of his content.
Anyway I’ve moved to other authors because there are sizable gaps of understanding to fill-in....</p>

    <h2>Matter of Life and Death</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Hypnotic start and common but strange finish.
Sometimes things not said or not shown are interesting.
Here I see ideas about thunderbolt, neuron growth, ladder, and “flight from Berlin”. Also script should have some ideas that did not make it into the movie.
There is propaganda angle to it which is fine by me. I think it is still strong even if the idea of Anglo-American cooperation in the new world is ignored....</p>

    <h2>Wired Encounters</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I was looking for a project this summer so I had some random interactions over the internet. Two of interactions had some strange quality.
One is what I recall as short and bald guy from post-Soviet territory. He had a very attentive look as if at every moment he was looking at spinning slots. He had a gambling project and he even said that involvement in such projects is less ethically challenging than being involved in prostitution business....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I’ve noticed new and unexpected juice-making machine in the shop I visit periodically. But also my path to shop goes near a juice-drinking joint that got closed a couple of months ago.
Now since the joint got closed there are dead bugs that seem to accumulate inside. And it has a very good overview with a wall of glass. So it is in a way like this big insect aquarium. It would be entertaining but I don’t believe that there is no limit to their accumulation....</p>

    <h2>Black Narcissus</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>It is a type of lucid Disney movie crossing into a horror film. The earliest erotic movie. Melodrama about nuns.
Spoilers may lie ahead.
Team In director’s commentary M. Powell mentions:
high quality of the team and art department cases of intrinsic match of actors to roles directors role of believing in the project how the team kind of lived through the movie (without big picture possibly?) And this final point probably assumes a degree of improvisation on actors part in the process and also a degree of freedom during the editing part....</p>

    <h2>Eyes Wide Shut</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context Even though I’ve seen some of this director and I recall some things to be interesting I otherwise avoided watching his work because the name seemed too popular. Checked this one for a random reason. I wasn’t sure about the choice for the first half maybe. But then the director delivered technically. And then I got to see the conception that is brilliant too.
Summary Delivered in colorful and crinkling packaging to distract the viewer; simultaneously Christmas and Halloween joke played right on the viewer; yet also having a personal down to earth snapshot of not obvious family business management at one point....</p>

   <p>I have experienced the sudden escalation effect of the picture. I wonder if background information and other pictures influenced that experience too or the picture is self-contained.
I assume this picture for me has opened the door for other works of the author. I wonder if it casts a shadow too.
Spoilers the artist was involved in stabbing a person to death over gambling matters English naming of picture sounds sharp other paintings too often have or imply sharp objects ...</p>
