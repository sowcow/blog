  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I’ve got a bit distracted into different nonsense lately. Then I’ve read some Gombrich and there he features the painting. The painting straightened me up a bit.
Gombrich gives enough tips to get you to find the answer but rightfully he does not offer the direct answer himself. This way he keeps magic of art for viewers to discover on their own.
Picture I enjoyed the piece for sure. If Gombrich abstains from giving away key findings then it is a good standard to adhere for me as well....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I didn’t plan to have a series of posts on my dentist experiences initially. But the times are strange already and fashion is ever changing so maybe this is going to be the new thing one day. In fact I’ll be the least surprised when celebrities start to post their selfies from dentist chairs with mouths open wide.
So after not seeing dentists for some time that was justified by different uncertainty I finally went to one and he told me that I can have three holes fixed in one session if I want to....</p>

   <p>Rich movie, unforgettable images Lots of echoes inside Suns and moons, ladders and crosses and rain Watching and thinking about movies like that leaves echoes in you and enhance perception of reality for some time. Again as in Mariken van Nieumeghen there was this effect when invisibles, things not shown, make you seek them and ultimately to find in some form.
Scenes and images may be viewed from different angles and the viewer is free to choose which way they go with the movie....</p>

   <p>Previously I had this assumption that the most valuable language to learn must be most different from the native tongue. Now while learning some Serbian I got to see that learning similar language has it own advantages. Because of similarities it is easier to see parallels and to reflect back on parts of the native language that you were not aware of. And even though actual etymology may be not as straight-forward as it seems, the current picture of a language matters....</p>

    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have seen both Insomnias - first the one by Nolan and then the one by Skjoldbjærg. I wanted to record something on this so Nolan goes first.
First I recognized some Twin Peaks atmosphere to it. Then also Nolan very explicitly plays with one straightforward idea and you can’t unsee it. This adds entertainment value all over the movie however slow it seems to be. Interestingly it makes some scenes way more memorable because you have more structure to them....</p>

    <h2>Conversation Piece</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the piece again and saw some of it’s riches.
The most obvious, simple yet exceptional scene that shows what can be called “unveiling”. Enjoyable echo to Vaghe stelle dell’Orsa right there. But the scene is crisp clear even by itself in the context of one movie.
Secondly there are scenes before and after it that have some non-obvious play too.
Not to say that I believe there is a mini-ghost in the movie too and I don’t know why yet....</p>

   <p>Awoke and looked at the starts in the night. Eyes may be more relaxed and sensitive at that time. Also I assume they may move slower and movements may be less calibrated.
Some stars are clear, some are twinkling, and other are faint. While clear stars make a space with landmarks. Through twinkling one comes to faint and they are the interesting ones. They are both fish and water of the night sky....</p>

    <h2>Polar Positions</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>On one hand I see that there is value in presence of actually polar positions. While on the other hand any polar by itself is likely to be destructive.
It is odd how this balance necessitates both polarization and tolerance. Operational democracy is a demanding beast.
Note I don’t pursue the topic systematically while complexities of it get my attention periodically. So I highlight some aspects that look new to me but since I don’t have a bigger picture yet there is a higher risk of misinterpretation and inherent incompleteness of statements....</p>
