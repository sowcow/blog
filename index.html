One Russian translator of ancient texts on a Russian Buddhism forum translated the topic statement with the meaning that the great city has no outskirts. And it makes sense in it’s way....</p>

    <h2>Genre Change</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Path Movie-wise personally the 2022 was marked by the sign of genre change. It has started with the Witch Burned Alive enchanting piece. It progressed into the dark-aesthetics and contrasting world of Mariken van Nieumeghen.
Then I hit the inverse apex of anti-aesthetics in re-watching some old clip on some odd verses by Epifancev. Given new tools this was readable and superficial/catchy but with presence of relatively sophisticated technology. Surely there can be different readings but I got one slice that makes experience easy and does not cause any kind of stackoverflows while having enough consistency and enough new learnings....</p>

    <h2>Mariken van Nieumeghen</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Deep and raw fish of a picture with strokes of celestial. May be dark at times and thus not for any audience and mood.
The director is a master of visual language. This is why the movie is rewatchable and rich.
I’ll just mention one scene.
The director talks straight: right above a door that Mariken enters he puts an exclamation mark with light and shadows. After that you see details that are necessary but I’ll skip them to not elaborate further....</p>

    <h2>Memento</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I ended-up watching some movies recently. One of them ended-up being Memento. Movies were good but I had no idea for a post until yesterday.
Idea The idea is that things that are not expressed may end-up being non-existing in the first place. This may not be an idea behind the movie but this is the idea behind the post in its way.
Movie The movie is an interesting patchwork of scenes that go in reverse chronological order....</p>

    <h2>Planet Parade</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Summary Good soviet movie about middle-aged males gathering for a trip. The viewer has lots of moments of reflection on deep matters of existence and life. Offering nostalgia and sharpened sense of time.
Context The movie was mentioned on Arestovich’s program twice AFAIK. So that added it to my list.
Normally after having listened to some classics it is especially hard to get me interesting in a soviet movie with military theme....</p>

    <h2>Tolerance</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>From a perspective of a random non-educated yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.
I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it’s power.
I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions even if they are loading them....</p>

    <h2>Vandals</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Incidents I got this mixed intuition about recent vandals activation. They happen to act right inside walls of Western public cultural institutions. So I wanted to untangle it.
Analysis My intuition (somewhat outsider) sees them as examples of hard deflection from the original Western values. And this deflection happens at the time of bigger challenges and higher-priority issues. And this context makes it look both pathetic in comparison and out of touch too....</p>

    <h2>Bloody Hand</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is a mode of looking when things look interesting. The mode actually takes you attention and there is wow-effect and it is not without minimal simplistic and mechanical “effort” to acheive and maintain. The effort is only in paying attention.
So I was looking at the hand of it. To see what it does: is it being nervous or what.
For me this is the liberating way to look at it....</p>

    <h2>Writing Libraries Is Considered Harmful</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>All similarities are accidental. All characters are fictional and have no relation to the real world.
I was reading one book on in a way advanced ruby. And since I know that the ruby community can be quite good the standard of expectations was quite high on my part. I imagine in my mind that the book is by somebody who also is a library writer.
So it definetly starts with some good stuff from the logics point of view....</p>
