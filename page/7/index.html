    <h2>Skin</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In the old times hunters used to skin animals and sell the result.
These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor. But the skin gets even more expensive!
And with all the abundant money supply these days also. I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.
Wild times they are!...</p>

    <h2>Blue Origin Flight</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So yesterday was the flight and I wanted to put some obvious observations here and mostly comparsion with Virgin Galactic flight about a week ago.
I only go from comparsion point of view because it makes it easy.
So first striking difference was that VG used Mr. Colbert to host the show while BO had some way more serious most of the time.
Altohugh I must say that one comic thing BO show host was doing repeatedly is reminding about Karman line in different ways and one time she even instantly followed Karman line remark with big windows remark....</p>

    <h2>The Eclipse</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was. First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background. Now I decided to try another one and you guess what. It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits. Then it contrasts it by some piano notes....</p>

    <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The one by Zeffirelli. Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.
The first impression is what is called “Tube sound” in Russia at least. So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case. After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive it is quality of the movie too. It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>It looks like get levelups and paid-for lessons from the marked every day.
Gotta write my thoughts somewhere so this place seems fit for that.
So I possibly see what is the difference between a complete “hamster” and a bit more strategic let’s say “hunter”.
Hamster has a very short information window and that makes the thinking impossible so he acts with lizard brain (so looses money). Also random tips or even other hamsters “thinking” and stuff that is not understandeable as price movement in the moment itself is also not a food for advanced brain so it shrinks its involvement I think and causes what it casuses....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.
It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images. As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision. And it was compelling in some way to me.
I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too....</p>

    <h2>Class War</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant I can’t be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it’s pillars.
One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes. Modern way is to call it oppression. Everybody loves new words.
And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his “followers” who established that soviet union rule here should be liars and anything they say must be deception....</p>

    <h2>Gravity</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the movie. It seems more balanced than Interstellar. It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that). But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.
It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.
It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological. Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense....</p>

   <p>The journey is so inspirational already. There is no doubt that I’m going to watch the launch live.

    <h2>Interstellar</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I’ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed....</p>
