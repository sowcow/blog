  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Just gotta make a post but there is not much I can say… I decided not to write the post right after watching because I thought the next day I may get some ideas…
I know this way of structuring stuff is stupid but whatever.
Pros:
 Some nice shots are present Some fun, absurd or just strange scenes are there  Cons:
 pace is not for me messy so called “psychological” stuff about characters being unhappy and all that does not attract me ugly sounds play from time to time  Notables:...</p>

    <h2>Ivory Tower</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have been watching some courses about decision making and stuff.
They are made very polished and in the modern-professional-looknig way:
 clean background and possibly interesting lightening very modern visuals supplementary slides (not too informative but still a requirement!) modern language is everywhere (also a bit pushed to the extreme - to show that modernness) made in multiple shots narrative is delivered from this device that runs text narrator makes pauses and intonations as device commands narrator even performs facial expressions to accompany material…  The only missing thing is these conventional simple piano melodies intervening here and there....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So I have rememberead a dream. And even though I don’t have intuitive inclanation to pay attention to it, it is a rare occasion and one aspect got me interested so I have paid some attention.
Anyway theme-wise it was like going for something and random situations happen in between. I remembered that the city is so well known to me like it is definetly not the first time I’m here and I know places even though it is not a specific real-world place....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Approach So I’m excited about my third approach of the market. It is different from the previous ones.
The latest thinking is that margin is by default is not going to be used at all.
I have an interesting idea to start with “paper-trading” and then introduce cash gradually (with randomness actually to even not know the size of the position first to be more chill). Actual paper-trading should address the greed to jump into the last wagon and be more chill....</p>

    <h2>The Adventure</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially the movie seems simple then I just got to think that it is not what I undestood enough to really write something constructive.
Anyway visually I’m just too easy to impress so I liked many “shots”.
There were also some of these scenes that directors do that take your breath without something explicitly dramatic happening.
I beleive it can have rewatch value but only in some very close-watch analysis mode…...</p>

    <h2>Rhytm</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Since I’m exploring music these days I have this unresolved question on the back of my mind about why people perceive rhytm in some special way.
I bet there are good scientific theories but I’m too lazy to check them so here are totally random thoughts:
 social activities like conversations have certain rhythm - so that mechanism is there to structure them hitting things overall may be a good training for war or hunting so people have this tendency to like such hitting-sequences: beats maybe just by rhythm of some pre-speech they were able to distinguish if a stranger has relation to their bigger tribe or not  ...</p>

    <h2>Beyond the Clouds</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I definetly liked some scenes most notably driving throug fog.
There are some obvious things directors do:
 in the beginning the face of the director is contrasted to white clouds (so you can see the a silhouette of the face in the white because of how seeing works) in the end the face of the director fades into darkness but you still see the silhouette you see water flow again - I still beleive it means flow of time/life the symbol of vase is mentioned - as something for flowers some scenes are deep and serious and some are too casual (surely intentinally but did different directors did them?...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>In the old times hunters used to skin animals and sell the result.
These days animals are getting extinct and cruel pratcices are out of favor. But the skin gets even more expensive!
And with all the abundant money supply these days also. I should not be surprised when I see a skin that costs millions of dollars.
Wild times they are!...</p>

    <h2>Blue Origin Flight</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So yesterday was the flight and I wanted to put some obvious observations here and mostly comparsion with Virgin Galactic flight about a week ago.
I only go from comparsion point of view because it makes it easy.
So first striking difference was that VG used Mr. Colbert to host the show while BO had some way more serious most of the time.
Altohugh I must say that one comic thing BO show host was doing repeatedly is reminding about Karman line in different ways and one time she even instantly followed Karman line remark with big windows remark....</p>

    <h2>The Eclipse</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>One notable thing my acquaintance with Antonioni is that how bad initial impression was. First I started watching one movie and just turned it off after having a minute or two watching at something ugly with construction sounds at the background. Now I decided to try another one and you guess what. It throws at you some totally mess of sounds during the initial credits. Then it contrasts it by some piano notes....</p>
