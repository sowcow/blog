    <h2>L Innocente</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I don’t use names here because they does not matter. It is not a movie for rewatching for me. I feel that that “dark freedom” mixed with good looks is a bit repulsive. One the other hand it still takes it’s own place. With it’s own confused ugliness in a nice shaped environment. But still roles do not deserve names from my point of view. No idea why.
TLDR: Crazy miscommunication between genders....</p>

    <h2>Senso</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Beautiful aesthetics. Not to say about views of Venice and Italy. Both strong feelings and something different also.
My version of the movie was missing Livia money explanation scene :). The actress plays very well if you ask me. But she convincingly plays something very different. So I can not imagine that scene and would like to see that!
There is a class difference that I see in different movies. Also there is blindness that is imposed on Livia by her nature....</p>

    <h2>Sect of Blindness</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I heave read about some strange practices that some marginal groups or individuals praticed. So there was something like trying to force oneself into seeing non-existing things and not seeing things that are there.
It looks like these days there are adpets at every corner. And they have acheived highest levels of trance.
I assume levels of subversion with the advent of mass media are so high. That they don’t need to pratice anything to get that state....</p>

    <h2>The First Summer</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I found that I pay attention to the good quality views around me more. Summer of course.
There is another thing possibly due to how my memory works. It looks like it is the first time I pay this much attention.
And I think this is the case in many cases.
Like horison line with trees looks so much better. Even colors of leafs and sky there.
Overall blossoming of course is so plentiful....</p>

    <h2>Lo Straniero / The Stranger</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: I have found out that it is by a novel by Camus so I bet this stuff is already analysed well. But I write my thoughts on the movie for myself partially to remember it better and partially to analyze it better in the process of writing/watching. Also writing stuff is not a bad idea by itself.
 Due to me confusing this movie with another I considered comments on the internet odd so I wasn’t excited to start watching it and delayed this movie....</p>

    <h2>Arts</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Disclaimer I’m totally amateur in all this stuff so this “early” perception/expectation may be defferent from what it is for people who know for sure.
Music Music was one of liberal arts education subjects. I strongly feel that it is for a reason.
On one hand music is a new space to explore so like every new space it offers certain hope and positive expectations.
On the other hand I think the gap between visual and audial is not as big as it seems....</p>

    <h2>Ossessione</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched Obsession by Visconti. I did it in two sessions and the movie is divided in two parts by itself also.
Spoilers ahead of course. I write stuf in two sessions so I may forgot something.
Lightning I like that at the time movies were made with lightning being used at the maximal capacity. You see it being used remarkably through the movie (from mine beginner-enthusiast point of view).
There are different small scenes that I noticed visually even if I don’t remember dialogs: only the theme or direction plus some visual clues....</p>

    <h2>Sandra | Vaghe stelle dell&#39;Orsa</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Context I decided to return to quality movies after having a break from wathing anything. And not having time organized resulted in me watching the movie in multiple sessins.
Thoughts It was always visually interesting experience for me. I didn’t expect black and white movies being such rich medium. Also all scenes with piano being played on camera I watched twice for sure.
I beleive there is a rewatch value of the movie overall even though it is not that complex in the story as I see it....</p>

    <h2>Negatives</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I don’t have any training or skill in writing but I like ceratin aspects of it and sometimes try to explore there.
The idea is to have a list where I can gradually put my accidental “images” that I like for some reason. I assume they can be “mine” but I’m not that sure in my memory to be certain.
If they are in negative shades and obviously exagregated they should not feel too bad or emotionally costly I think because that is not the point....</p>
