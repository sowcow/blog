    <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The one by Zeffirelli. Planned to watch this in two session but got too interested and watched in one.
The first impression is what is called “Tube sound” in Russia at least. So it is more warm and comfortable quality of picture in this case. After watching two modern space movies previously there is no surprise, but I beleive it is quality of the movie too. It is wild but in more natural way because it is a comedy....</p>

   <p>It looks like get levelups and paid-for lessons from the marked every day.
Gotta write my thoughts somewhere so this place seems fit for that.
So I possibly see what is the difference between a complete “hamster” and a bit more strategic let’s say “hunter”.
Hamster has a very short information window and that makes the thinking impossible so he acts with lizard brain (so looses money). Also random tips or even other hamsters “thinking” and stuff that is not understandeable as price movement in the moment itself is also not a food for advanced brain so it shrinks its involvement I think and causes what it casuses....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched it some time ago so I may forget someting that I wanted to say here.
It is exalted. I remember that there are some nice images. As a viewer I did beleive that the guy has a vision. And it was compelling in some way to me.
I remembered very obvious scene when the ceremony when hair being cut is followed by sheep flock with some of them being cut too....</p>

    <h2>Class War</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Living in post-soviet union land and having lots of inheritance left and still having big parts of it being relevant I can’t be neutral towards the ideology of that time and it’s pillars.
One thing that is a pillar AFAIK is the warfare between classes. Modern way is to call it oppression. Everybody loves new words.
And I also thought that Marx and all criminal his “followers” who established that soviet union rule here should be liars and anything they say must be deception....</p>

    <h2>Gravity</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched the movie. It seems more balanced than Interstellar. It has both cheesy stuff like males self-sacraficing while looking into females face (Interstellar also has exactly that). But it also has more like that will and action against entropy and even gravity itself.
It has some naked legs Lara Croft action too.
It has some of what can be commonly referred as psychological. Initially Lara :) is being handled like a baby in that sense....</p>

   <p>The journey is so inspirational already. There is no doubt that I’m going to watch the launch live.
 we are taking impossible and making it inevitable you need the best humans to work on programs like these  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s...</p>

    <h2>Interstellar</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Yesterday, one day before the historic Unity22 launch I decided to watch Inception. I remembered that the movie was annoying alot of times but stil gave it a try. So this post is about that experience.
Positives I’ll start with positives to not be too harsh.
The plot seems to be more interesting that I remembered initially. There were a couple of cool visuals, some nice scenes overall or even I appreciated how certain scenes were directed....</p>

    <h2>Hamlet</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli. Not in one session on one hand. But on the other hand the second session was something different and very fresh for me.
Alot of times the picture just looks well. I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.
In school I didn’t read stuff. They forced stuff on us and it didn’t work for me. After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Got some cool ride in all directions from SPCE recently.
So I got alot of not-easily to reconcile experience that is not cheep also.
Anyway gotta write some my levelup thoughts so I remember them better.
 Unexpected stuff happens at any time and in any combinations. Gotta learn and be ready (chosen strategy) from the decision point. it is about strategy choice from options and then appropriate execution plan and execution and not about any price moves at all margin is a wild thingy, I’m not used to that now but gotta improve :) also one should be able to ignore price movements and forget about the account money (and potentially have more cash to compensate for it if negative news coming-out) intraday requires back-testing and knowledge of probabilities and stop-loss distance is a crucial part of it and actualy automated system I think (so is not really an option outside of some obvious “rockets”) other than intraday holding without margin is easy thing to do but take profits should be automated entry also should be distributed over a period where you want to flatten price movements and completely ignore them manipulations or unexpected stuff happens so one cannot be unprepared to anything if you watch at the price charts forget ease and comfort irregardless of where the price goes it is like a work - you need to be on time on crucial points and be ready (also timeboxed decision making, not random urgent stupid actions) in a way being serious and methodical works I beleive but also being open-minded for unexpected stuff is a necessary part of it!...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.
First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks. And I holded them. Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.
Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold. And missed some good actual run from that point....</p>
