    <h2>Dream Flies</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So I got a random dream some days ago. In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn’t do for a number of years). Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.
I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner....</p>

   <p>I stumbled upon this one even though it was not one on the recommendations list. I just got to like it and finished. Touches different aspects without staying there for too long. Has nice quotes and seduces you with colorful images. Seems nice for beginners....</p>

    <h2>TTC Learning German</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I started this course some time ago and then got distracted. I got to reorganize my goals recently so I returned to it and it goes well this time.
One thing I noticed this time is that the quality of the production is actually good and helps the viewer. For example at any point one can move the attention to say creative stage background that is a mess too. It looks like somebodies experiments but it offers a light puzzle-like content to check at any point....</p>

   <p>I want to put stuff somewhere but probably there is not enough for separate posts.
Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator (Aug 25) It is the most recomended one on the subject. It is cool in its own way. But not in the way it is recommended by many....</p>

    <h2>Eternal</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Recently I have heard the idea that art is eternal.
Many years before I have heard also that artists pursue immortality through art. And my silly understanding of that was that they move from and not move toward. This is a good example of how easily words can convey wrong or useless meaning.
I like the idea that the meaning of eternal is that it concurs what is timely. Since I started to pay more attention to classical music, I think it does....</p>

    <h2>Whispering Propaganda</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Post-soviet land has it’s own charm and peculiarities. One of these is propaganda.
Today I noticed something. Imagine hearing talk about war atrocities of your ideological opponents in a kind of whispering way from the TV.
This kind of content, even if dirty, still can make one proud of local acheivements in propaganda.
Western propaganda that I’m exposed to is not of a good taste for me. I cannot enjoy the cheap way it is delivered....</p>

    <h2>Burn After Reading</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Initially I thought that “extremely funny nonsense” describes it all and there is no point to have a post about it.
But then there was another thought that there are multiple stories of different characters and the whole thing is such a mess and is intensive. So that it may require some tools to weave that. Also I have heard that all plots are known already so I bet these directors innovated a bit or used some modern tools to construct that....</p>

    <h2>Contextless</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is an interesting for me kind of posts where I explore near some more practical idea and that idea by itself may be only lightly implied or touched. Or I go on some random tangent and the case that got me writing is completely ignored.
In this one the tangent is that contextless things imply reactive behavior.
So I think that goal of advertisments for exapmle is to distract a person into situation for which the subject does not have the context ready....</p>

    <h2>Continuity of Space</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So this is one of those posts with such name that only me can guess the content and also only while I have the idea in focus.
Abstract:
 time is not really continuous since it is a sequence of different events there may be something like subjective that persists through time but it is not as evident so you can’t put your attention on it the space around us is what is actually persistent and there are natural faculties of observation and memory about it active attention is what I mean in the post....</p>

   <p>I did not expect this from a black and white movie somehow but it always finds a way to astonish you.
I don’t know what to add here because it is plain yet very effective. I have strong impression that there is no puzzle that I’m so used to like. But the experience by itself does not ask for explanation. It is just that odd and in a way immutable. This way of looking at it seems new to me....</p>
