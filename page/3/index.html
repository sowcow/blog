    <h2>Tolerance</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>From a perspective of a random non-educated yet not-indoctrinated person notions used for public may seem too vaguely defined and thus being abused to support whatever they must.
I feel like there should be a specific subset in this notion of tolerance that is not being corrupted by the game and this is where it takes it’s power.
I like how this would mean that even questionable politicians are forced to use the right notions even if they are loading them....</p>

    <h2>Vandals</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Incidents I got this mixed intuition about recent vandals activation. They happen to act right inside walls of Western public cultural institutions. So I wanted to untangle it.
Analysis My intuition (somewhat outsider) sees them as examples of hard deflection from the original Western values. And this deflection happens at the time of bigger challenges and higher-priority issues. And this context makes it look both pathetic in comparison and out of touch too....</p>

    <h2>Bloody Hand</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There is a mode of looking when things look interesting. The mode actually takes you attention and there is wow-effect and it is not without minimal simplistic and mechanical “effort” to acheive and maintain. The effort is only in paying attention.
So I was looking at the hand of it. To see what it does: is it being nervous or what.
For me this is the liberating way to look at it....</p>

    <h2>Writing Libraries Is Considered Harmful</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>All similarities are accidental. All characters are fictional and have no relation to the real world.
I was reading one book on in a way advanced ruby. And since I know that the ruby community can be quite good the standard of expectations was quite high on my part. I imagine in my mind that the book is by somebody who also is a library writer.
So it definetly starts with some good stuff from the logics point of view....</p>

   <p>I have a strange relation with this type of content. I may get attracted to availability and perceived richness of content. But then I’ll get discouraged because it often may end-up being some story-telling.
Anyway social skills have a good marginal utility for me so I got to check what is there on the surface.
One book named “Surrounded by Idiots” was reviewed as being very useful for the HR and managerial crowd....</p>

    <h2>Peeping Tom</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Spoiler alert and all that.
I watched Peeping Tom a couple of weeks ago. It is now or never I should write-down what I thought about it.
Key points  many things at once is how I see it the idea that fear is the scariest thing is liberating lots of visual language, some just makes you puzzled, some is obvious it succeeded at confusing me at points surely effect: not scared but puzzled (which is good, scaredness would inhibit analysis) high contrast movie: hilarious/odd/interesting scenes, different personalities, direct contrast and directors tools can be seen or you just feel their presence even if not sure what exactly is there; fearless desensitized vs fearless normal magic camera aspect I have not resolved - some positive vision probably topic of desensitization by the industry enjoyed accents  Quality  all this baits you in for partial-rewatch even though there is some empuzzlement and repulsion present as a general feeling but the director did his work by quality in all regards to cover for the theme effect; the movie is like a shopping stall of goods about directing things and producing effects, “things perceptable and the general level is not distracting your from products”, so there should be rewatch value from that for sure; it is not at all an ADHD fast-paced salad so you have your time to think about stuff, I liked that for sure, yet it leaves an impresson of being filled with quality material;  Exceprts That “he is the director” I understood it (but not at that moment) as both:...</p>

    <h2>Toothpaste of Wisdom</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>My tooth pase every day recommends me to save water. The problem is that I have a couple of bottles saved and they stand on a visible place too.
So I follow trends and all that but my paste keeps demanding more…
So I thought what if I buy not the cheap paste but some premium version, will the banner disappear? Or at least can I get a better more premium-customer advice then?...</p>

    <h2>Demoralization by Example</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>There are different meanings of demoralization that I’m aware of:
 Bezmenov meant total war by exporting ideologies that wipe-out moral reference-points and cause fracturing and internal conflict. Arestovich was talking about waves-like dynamics, I assume due to bio-chemistry that is more cyclical and maybe caused by strong stimuli in the first place (interestingly I got some of that observed by myself)  There should be more for sure but I like the interesting ones and I got this idea that some signal demoralization (non-consuciously like most of things surely) as some kind of warfare against mirror-neurones of others....</p>

   <p>I haven’t read anything on this. So this is just toying around for the sake of seeing where it leads.
General I assume thinking requires certain context being fixed. So by affecting this context they affect following thinking.
Scales of Stories/Thinking  high-level: geographical: alliances, resources middle level: normal human thinking in the more understandeable/predictable world mechanical scale: short-term or magical thinking in unpredictable conditions  Dehumanization* My guess is that propaganda institutions pollute the middle level and provide conditions for thinking in other levels....</p>
