   <p>It is in a way like in that movie: Inception. There are forgotten situations that has power over you. And there are symbols that you get to have around instead. At some point you decode the symbols back.
It feels energetic but calming. It is too rare an experience to not record it....</p>

   <p>Reading Concerning reading/audio I have finished Orthodoxy. I wanted to write about it but it is not the case that I am 100% sure about my own view on these topics. Anyway there is a lot of good stuff in the book overall.
Basically the author likes his choice/experience and consistency is not the only value he needs. Although in public policy I would be aganist things like that. Even though author mildly argues for that also....</p>

   <p>I almost stopped reading stuff so I didn’t write about anything interesting.
Although I have started listening to Chesterton’s Orthodoxy and I have given couple of small attempts to continue/restart reading Droyzen and Livy. I’m not doing it methodically and I’m not really in control of personal time now.
So I decided to write about what I have in mind to address that.
First there is an app idea that I develop when I feel like and then I move to something else....</p>

   <p>I think this post spoils the movie in a way. It can provide different experience to somebody else.
 I have watched the movie. Although art is not somethig I know much, I have a couple of thoughts about art after the movie.
It is about making a name So the stuff modernists produce by just exploring the medium before others done it is worth as much as random numbers....</p>

   <p>– Hear me today discoursing in the house of Quadratus.
– Why should I hear you? Do you wish to show me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together man. And what good will it do you?
 So I have finished listening to an audiobook of teachings of Epictetus. The audiobook is performed by Hayward Morse.
The content is both very sober, straightforward and logical as it is also entertaining and with a lot of humour....</p>

   <p>I knew about the guy previously but I was avoiding getting into his stuff at all. But this time I decided to look into his content.
First I got into some debate youtube videos of him. And it was ok.
So I decided to look into his audiobook.
I found the first part quite informative for me:
 I really like biological facts about how things work Christianity as a big sacrafice was new information for me I also enjoyed different literary excerpts (Dostoevsky and others)  But then after 50% the real fun starts....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>While reading Marxism by T. Sowell I cought myself on thoughts that the stuff is not as ugly as what is claimed to be applications of it. The stuff even felt attractive in theory.
So I quickly visited one site to see what ideas are there these days.
What I found is some pool of mud filled with red-herrings and repeated talking points. It didn’t look that the writers are entirely dumb but that they are a bit psychotic and very ideological and partisan....</p>

   <p>I have a couple of things that I noticed while reading “Discrimination and Disparities” by T. Sowell.
Obviously the authour is a very logical and factual no BS guy.
The book is full of tricks politicans use and facts they tend to hide.
I noticed this disambiguation of the term “discrimination” by the author:
 evidence based discrimination (1A): based on knowledge of traits and behavior of a given individual evidence based discrimination (1B): based on statistics on group behavior, traits arbitrary discrimination (2): arbitrary/irrational  This is how I understood this....</p>

    <h2>Tar Pit</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I decided to write short summary and some ideas after reading “Out of the Tar Pit”.
Summary It looks like a theoretical high level paper about comlexity in large codebases.
The main point can be statend in the form: eliminate stuff/separate certain parts of the system to reduce power/ability to introduce accedintal complexity.
What is being separated: essential state, essential logic, control.
Also proposed ways to implement these parts:
 state - relaitons logic - pure functions  My Thoughts I am pretty convinced that relations are the way to go for the essential state....</p>
