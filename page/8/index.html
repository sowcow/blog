    <h2>Hamlet</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched Hamlet by Zefirelli. Not in one session on one hand. But on the other hand the second session was something different and very fresh for me.
Alot of times the picture just looks well. I definetly need to get to the bottom of it why.
In school I didn’t read stuff. They forced stuff on us and it didn’t work for me. After the movie and looking how strangely the story goes I thought about reconsidering that....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Got some cool ride in all directions from SPCE recently.
So I got alot of not-easily to reconcile experience that is not cheep also.
Anyway gotta write some my levelup thoughts so I remember them better.
 Unexpected stuff happens at any time and in any combinations. Gotta learn and be ready (chosen strategy) from the decision point. it is about strategy choice from options and then appropriate execution plan and execution and not about any price moves at all margin is a wild thingy, I’m not used to that now but gotta improve :) also one should be able to ignore price movements and forget about the account money (and potentially have more cash to compensate for it if negative news coming-out) intraday requires back-testing and knowledge of probabilities and stop-loss distance is a crucial part of it and actualy automated system I think (so is not really an option outside of some obvious “rockets”) other than intraday holding without margin is easy thing to do but take profits should be automated entry also should be distributed over a period where you want to flatten price movements and completely ignore them manipulations or unexpected stuff happens so one cannot be unprepared to anything if you watch at the price charts forget ease and comfort irregardless of where the price goes it is like a work - you need to be on time on crucial points and be ready (also timeboxed decision making, not random urgent stupid actions) in a way being serious and methodical works I beleive but also being open-minded for unexpected stuff is a necessary part of it!...</p>

    <h2>Hamstering</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So here I will write and update on my level-upping as amateur on the market.
First in august 2020 probably I got some BA, oil and mostly boring military stocks. And I holded them. Then I beleive at the president election there was some run that I missed probably.
Then there was a vaccine news and I holded for one more day and sold. And missed some good actual run from that point....</p>

    <h2>Virgin</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Interesting stuff with Virgin Galactic stock. Alot of people mad and alot of people made money.
Some theories on what happened:
 Jeff Who is being salty and is shorting with all the cash stock offering profit fixation on the main session  A lot of hamsters (including me) who missed the tesla hype expected the SPCE to became the new one. And I beleive that accounted for bigger than normal swings....</p>

    <h2>Tea with Mussolini</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>The movie is like a story with different aspects to it. It has a bit of everything from nice views to light comedy and interesting people in odd situations. But then it turned to be a small puzzle that I got solved here while writing the post.
One thing I got to remember are how imposing Mussolini’s table is. Another thing is how nicely and lightly trashy art is being advertised in one scene....</p>

    <h2>Zeffirelli</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Here I should have impressions on the works of the director.
Romeo and Juliet I’m not going to analyse the content here. Because there has to be more than enough high-quality analysis of Shakespeare.
I liked the main theme. And some scenes for sure. And almost all main characters even if they all act as possessed at different times.
One thing about the movie is that in the process it looks as overly exaggregated and theatrical (as is expected)....</p>

   <p>I beleive I found explanation to what caused all the 20th century chaos and ugliness.
One could say it is human nature or nature of existance overall. But I want to get more specific answer.
But even to say that the guy Marx started all the hastle without knowing it is not specific enough. Because one can still zoom-in to find for more fine answer.
I was thinking about it and I think I finally got it....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I got to beleive that form is more important than the content. Probably because it has to be a reflection of the owner of the content.
So these days I pay attention to form and that affect decisions....</p>

    <h2>Exit Strategy</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I notice that I too often don’t have exit strategy. And that single-directedness causes suboptimal behavior.
So actually even if I plan to go and do something. It is useful to have a plan B of how not to do that…
Sounds odd but this is the case for automoton like me!...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Abstract Open libraries are so cool. They motivate by themselves. Borrowing and kind-of a limit of time makes the book even more attractive.
Here I just do own notes to review them after I finished reading. It is not something pretending to have been carefully extracted and distilled. Sometimes in the process I just do not record stuff, sometimes I record alot more.
