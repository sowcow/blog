    <h2>Cavalleria Rusticana</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Watched it without subtitles or anything. Actually didn’t even know the libretto and the name of what I was watching.
Normally tragedy is not the genre I watch or even understand. I’m repulced by the ending of Lakme for example. Some things should not be played because they can’t be played truthfully I believe. But probably I’m getting to be more open minded about the genre.
This time I found myself being very empathetic to Elena Obrazcova so I believe she played well....</p>

    <h2>Sunday Propaganda</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I have just returned from a walk. On the way back I have heared local church bells ringing. I tried to look at it and wasn’t able to see anything behind trees except some yellow glow. So these “golden-hats” the church has make it possible to see it even further. I wonder if their angle is such to cover the maximum area in early day hours.
There is another traditional thing you may be sure of on sundays....</p>

    <h2>Meet Joe Black</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>You see the good quality there. There is class I believe too.
One can say that the play is very detailed. Even this that is not what I’m used to capture but it is definetly visible.
The topic touched is often serious so to move to another scene the director has small humorous scenes.
Overall pace may be slow and the length is longish. At some points you may think: “What kind of dialogs are these?...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I watched some of it. I’ll go through impressions and then focus on the good part at the end.
Other The part by Antonioni has some nice art shown.
The part by Bertolucci made to be more dynamic wich is a nice idea and it has things with some added meaning like ending for sure. (I assume that is related to fascism but AFAIK the director didn’t really live through that time....</p>

    <h2>Jesus of Nazareth (upd: final episode)</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>NOTE: spoils may lie ahead.
I watched only the first part of fourth at this point.
 like I guess all Zeffirelli movies this one has beautiful nature shots also some interesting shots overall there is some flavor to Judea in the movie but maybe less about characters and more about smaller occasions like in all Zeffirelli movies the beginning is not as interesting for me as when things get going I have an impression that the beginning is very feminine in some way too unrelated to that in the beginning there is so much talking without blinking and in some special/magical fashion (especially noticable given me loosing remainings of enchantment of religion just recently while looking at religious officials opening a warrior monument that may be controversial) in that “surrounding” Herod looked as the most understandeable/relateable guy in the beginning but then he goes mad and later previous tranquility is festively contrasted by different rampant sinners and John the Baptist  Then I found out that there are three more parts but I liked the idea....</p>

    <h2>The Righteous Mind</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Found-out that scribd has some good stuff that I wanted to check like this title. So I got over first three chapters in audio format. Looking at how it goes I would switch to the short version in this case.
 Don’t eat while listening to it because the author does alot of stuff in the beginning for sure. I think consciously but who knows; Even though narrated by the author the experience is very copy-paste/so-conventional from the execution point of view....</p>

   <p>Заранее сорри за грамматику.
Не то чтобы я хэйтвочил много, но, то что они показывают на выходных заслуживает особого внимания. И вот В эту субботу на телевидении с утреца была передача про параною. Что якобы многие боятся слежки со всех сторон.
Бывает вербное воскресенье, а тут на тебе - фобная суббота....</p>

    <h2>Il Conformista</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>First. Visually interesting without question. I also liked characters there. Of course there is that standard that one expects from classics so I shortly stop praising the movie here.
The movie is bigger than what I can safely analyze. And it probably does not answer the question that leads me to watching it.
There is this word “soviet intelligent-sy”. It is a negative term for educated but very useful conformists of that time....</p>

    <h2>Some Taste</h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Usually I’m not big into reading and reading newspapers. But a couple days ago I stumbled upon one article. Actually the article won the competition among other headers first. Then I just got to like the rich tools used in the content. Basically the article got me captured starting from the header.
And this is unusual for me. So I checked the author. She has only one another article there. But there are many other books and articles in foreign media too....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>So I got a random dream some days ago. In a dream I smoked (which IRL I didn’t do for a number of years). Then a bunch of flies showed up and some got stuck to my hand and one even got into my nose forcing me to forcefully breath-out.
I like how my brain is smart and has intervened in this direct manner....</p>
